Why not let any small group demand a change with little relative impact? <br/> "...why challenge any assumption?" <br/> I'm not arguing that law shouldn't change. I'm arguing that law developed under one set of assumptions should be blindly applied to a different scenario. Read my rebuttal to res0ndf7 for more on this line.

An action is ethical if society as a whole would benefit if we all did it. Fair enough? <br/> If everyone had a gay marriage, then society as a whole would NOT benefit.

Let the churches perform marriages, get the government out completely.

Like I said, if there were not tax breaks or incentives to be married in the eyes of the state, who cares. My church doesn't support it. It irks me that people who claim to Christians support it and even allow homosexual clergy.	Why are you arguing about a U.S. decision when you are in Canada?

65364_12417	a1	Marriage evolved because of moral and religious grounds rather than a mere union approved by the state... To debase marriage just to accomodate base desires of gay couples in disguise if a right is simply stupid...	Gay people are making a terrible mistake. I think they are living the life right now with not having to commit to anything. If it was like that for normal marriage life would be a whole lot better.
12399_70817	a2	for the record - I am not gay. I'm married and have a little daughter.	Same sex marrage can couse a lot of contriverse, it puts peoples life at risk in extrem cases gay marrage has caused so much trouble pepole has resulted in murder and sucied

31527_76357	a1	The Marriage issue should be out of politicians and lawmakers. Marriages are for the Church to decide, Congress have no power to pass a legislation forcing religious institutions about marriage.

73436_12441	a1	Marriage is between a man and a woman. It has always been so. If two people want to live in Sin together, I have no problem with that. However, they shouldn't be rewarded with tax breaks. And I sure don't want them to have a platform to spew their garbage and cram it down my kids' throat. Since Homosexuality is a learned sin (think about it) I don't want my kids to learn that it is ok.

An action is ethical if society as a whole would benefit if we all did it. Fair enough? <br/> If everyone had a gay marriage, then society as a whole would NOT benefit.

12417_70614	a2	Gay people are making a terrible mistake. I think they are living the life right now with not having to commit to anything. If it was like that for normal marriage life would be a whole lot better.	Two men/women together does not seem natural. Although we know the world is changing and there are new ideas the purpose of two humans being together is to reproduce and make new life. Marriage is in front of God and the words are taken from the Bible but it is obvious that God does not approve of this so doesn't it seem ironic in a way?

12447_12440	a1	Is marriage really just about "love?" I think not. It's about societal norms. It's about legal rights. It's about families. It's about generations. It's about example. It's about commitment. It's about tax breaks. It's about parental roles. If it were just about "love" then I could marry my dog and two kids at the local middle-school could get married as well. It's not only about love.	Here is a reason why gay marriage could be wrong. If gay marriage is ok, then sister and brother marriage is ok too? Whats the difference? Oh wait, the sex is the difference, so SISTER and SISTER or BROTHER and BROTHER is ok... right?
12399_30502	a2	for the record - I am not gay. I'm married and have a little daughter.	I'm an avid christian and I believe that gay marriage is wrong beyond belief. This country was founded on christian beliefs, and we should adhere to the belifs used to make us what we are today.
48935_32066	a1	From a biological standpoint, men and women were "engineered" to be together. This idea was corrupted by the morals and society of our time.	there is no such thing as "gay marriage". Marriage can only be between a man and a woman.

I wish the argument/rebuttal system on the site were better.	Two men/women together does not seem natural. Although we know the world is changing and there are new ideas the purpose of two humans being together is to reproduce and make new life. Marriage is in front of God and the words are taken from the Bible but it is obvious that God does not approve of this so doesn't it seem ironic in a way?

12414_12431	a2	I vote "Wrong". It goes against human nature and, as other fellow voters have mentioned, the definition of "Marriage". <br/> And you can't exclude religion from this argument, because thats what happened when people don't have faith or belief in any religion. Religion is there to act as guidelines to what is right and what is wrong. Religion is a way of life. Without it, we're lost.	I did not propose "separate but equal." I proposed "distinct and different." Man/woman relationships, especially in the aggregate, have a very different set of implications than man/man and woman/woman relationships. If the law is to contemplate man/woman relationships intelligently, it has to be able to isolate them. <br/> A law requiring separate schools and public accomodations for homosexual people would violate "separate but equal." Law defining marriage as a man/woman relationship does not.

70817_12421	a2	Same sex marrage can couse a lot of contriverse, it puts peoples life at risk in extrem cases gay marrage has caused so much trouble pepole has resulted in murder and sucied	The real issue is - why is the government involved in this issue at all?

Fair enough? <br/> If everyone had a gay marriage, then society as a whole would NOT benefit. In fact, we would all become extinct, because without one man and one woman there would be no reproduction and continuation of our species. <br/> Therefore, gay marriage can't be ethical. <br/> You can't refute my statement by saying, "There will always be straight people" because that's like saying killing someone is right because there will always be those who won't kill.

In fact, we would all become extinct, because without one man and one woman there would be no reproduction and continuation of our species. <br/> Therefore, gay marriage can't be ethical. <br/> You can't refute my statement by saying, "There will always be straight people" because that's like saying killing someone is right because there will always be those who won't kill.

30502_70614	a2	I'm an avid christian and I believe that gay marriage is wrong beyond belief.

If homosexuality was natural then the butthole would be in the front part of the body. <br/> Its never been accepted as "natural" by society only till now.

But everyone isn't religious or adheres to specific religious guidance. <br/> Marriage is defined as between a woman and a man. So the word "marriage" may be misused in this case. Civil unions, well that's a different matter.	Is marriage really just about "love?" I think not. It's about societal norms. It's about legal rights. It's about families. It's about generations. It's about example. It's about commitment. It's about tax breaks. It's about parental roles. If it were just about "love" then I could marry my dog and two kids at the local middle-school could get married as well. It's not only about love.

Why don't we just get rid of any incentive to be married, politically that is. No tax deductions, no married filing jointly; nothing. Let the churches perform marriages, get the government out completely. If a particular denomination wants to condone homosexuality let them, it's them that are going against their religion. <br/> I don't support it. Like I said, if there were not tax breaks or incentives to be married in the eyes of the state, who cares. My church doesn't support it. It irks me that people who claim to Christians support it and even allow homosexual clergy.
