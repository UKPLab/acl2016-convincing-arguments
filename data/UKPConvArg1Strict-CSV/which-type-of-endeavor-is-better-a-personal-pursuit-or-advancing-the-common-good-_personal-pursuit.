arg33101_arg33086	a2	Personal pursuit is better because people will be people and want to be the best they can be and they want to be on the top. I know I want to be a "winner". Which by this happening it means that someone has to be a loser. This is personal pursuit.	A personal pursuit is a better endeavor because you are fulfilling something within yourself. It is important to help others but there is a time to do so. Achieving a personal goal is a journey to fulfillment where one is truly happy. Before helping others you must remember about yourself, but you must not forget about those who are really in need.
arg33053_arg33125	a2	In my personal opinion if you better yourself in the long run you can better the world. I mean you have to focus on yourself before you can take on the problems of the world and trying to fix them, or you will end up having a break down or something.	I think that focusing on a personal persuit comes first, going to college, having a career, and reaching a position of power. I don't think there really is a day when you will announce to the world that your going to advance the common good, but you can help people here and there, donating a little bit of time, donating a little money, but in the end if your ever in the position of power and have money you could truly advance the common good.
arg33070_arg33121	a1	I believe it is more important to have personal pursuit because if you even want to begin to help others you have to help yourself. It's not bad to want to help the common good but if you're always putting other people before yourself you may start to forget about your own needs and wants in life. But I do think that you can have a balance of both.	Our animal insctinc is survival, its what makes us flinch wen we see something coming at ous it makes us react faster, our mental state changes. In todays post modern world, our instinc have change into keep obtaining money to keep ous alive. times change but our desire to survive above other is still thier.

Which by this happening it means that someone has to be a loser. This is personal pursuit.	I think i will go with personal persuit because no matter what we do we think of ourself first. I think its the human nature.But personal pursuit does not mean being selfish and only caring about oneself.I need to think about me first,success and then think of others. Everyone does think of themselves before thinking about others. First i need to make me happy to make others happy. This way i can make my life better and be who i am.
arg33102_arg33145	a1	Unfortunately it is human nature to be selfish. This doesn't always mean that you are going to be a mean person and always do what is best for you, but an individual will usually help himself first. Sometimes in a good situation going out on your own personal pursuit does advance the common good. Neither is necessarily better but I believe that a personal pursuit might be more useful we only live this life for so long and we want to be the best we can be. Maybe your personal pursuit is to advance the common good.	I feel that a personal pursuit is a better endeavor. Your personal pursuit should come first before anyone else's. But then again I really don't know, because if someone in your family is in need of something then you're going to do anything help that family member out. I believe that helping someone in your family is just something you do no matter what because they're blood. If someone who you don't know is in need at the same time as someone who is related to you, you're going to help the family member out instead of the random person you don't know.
arg33167_arg33088	a1	I believe that personal pursuit is better because in order to help others you have to help yoursel first. I also think that if you are happy with yourself and enjoy helping others you have the confidence and strength to help the outside world while satisfying yourself. For example, someone wants to succeed in life and through that he achieves his goals, whenever he is already succesful and with money he decides to help others.	I feel like it is better to do both, but in order to help others you need to help yourself. It all starts with your personal goals before you can help others.

In todays post modern world, our instinc have change into keep obtaining money to keep ous alive. times change but our desire to survive above other is still thier.	A personal pursuit is more important to me, because every person is responsible for themselves and their own actions. Advancing the common good would just mean that one or two people may not have to work as hard as you would for the same thing because of something you may have done. A personal pursuit can never be inequal. You'll always be able to dig yourself as deep into a hole as you want to, but standing as one person rather than many, you could probably dig faster if you were alone.

Maybe your personal pursuit is to advance the common good.	I believe a personal pursuit is better for me because I'm more of a selfish person. I rather do something that is going to better my life, but every once in a while I do have my giving moments, so I guess it depends on how I am feeling. Right now I am going to go for the personal pursuit.
arg33157_arg33123	a2	If i say that advencing the commen good is better then a personal pursuit, then i would be lieing to myself. Everyone wants to do good in the world, but the problem with that is that their is too many bad things happening in the world, and what you do wont really make a difference. A personal persuit does more for you then trying to advance the commen good in a world where you see very little good.	In order to help advance a common good, you must first realize what is your common good. You have to know when you are that better person to then spread your good to other people. You can't just assume that you are a great person if you don't have anything to show it. If you desire to see a world full of all this goodness, YOU have to be that spark that starts the fire.
arg33070_arg33165	a1	I believe it is more important to have personal pursuit because if you even want to begin to help others you have to help yourself. It's not bad to want to help the common good but if you're always putting other people before yourself you may start to forget about your own needs and wants in life. But I do think that you can have a balance of both.	Personal pursuit is better because its easier to help yourself then it is to help others. Plus not all people want to be helped. A persons' need is more important then others need, you need to your personal pursuits first. In this world you have to fight for what you want.

arg33126_arg33054	a1	Helping others for the common good can give you a feeling of pride but you have to have the means to be able to help the other person. To have those means you first have to have personal pursuit. I don't think one is better than the other but you first have to have personal pursuit before you can have common good. However for some people their personal pursuit can be the advancement of the common good.	I believe personal persuit. Human nature is for someone to persue things for themselves, not for others.
arg33105_arg33128	a1	it is better to help yourself before you can help others. for instance, if you don't have your life together how are you going to help someone else with theirs. if your still living at home with your mother and you don't have a job and one want to help out by giving to an organization you couldn't do it. so basically you have to help yourself before you can help others.	Well for me its a kind of a 50/50. I think that evryone should be less selfish and do things that are "advancing the common good", but then again on the other hand we live in the real world and we are going to things that better benifit us. For example in your job your not going to try to make another employe, your going to try to make yourself look good so that you will get more money.

I rather do something that is going to better my life, but every once in a while I do have my giving moments, so I guess it depends on how I am feeling. Right now I am going to go for the personal pursuit.	Personally i think that if you are not helping yourself you cant help no one else. If you try to help every person that needs your help, they will just slow you down. Don't get me wrong helping people is always right. In the big picture if you pursuit your dreams and get rich, fame, and power you will be able to help the people that matter to you.
arg33058_arg33054	a1	I believe that personal pursuit is better because one must themselves happy before they can go out into the world and try to make everyone else happy.

Some people find that helping others is their own pursuit of happiness.	I believe personal persuit. Human nature is for someone to persue things for themselves, not for others.
arg33158_arg33091	a2	Obviously everybody wants to say that they would help mankind, the world or save the city, but only a small percent of people would actually do this. I honestly would like to help mankind. I would like to save the world, but I'm posting under personal pursuit because I do not know what I would do in one of these situations. <br/> Anyway, if people did believe in the advancement of the common good all of the economical cars and factories wouldn't just now be made. These inventions would have come out as soon as the theory of global warming came out.	A personal pursuit of mine has always been to be the best pole vaulter that I can be, or the best at anything you do. I have learned that while trying to achieve this personal goal I have learned so much about trying to be a more responsible and more obedient. I believe in pursuing personal pursuit and personal goals is a better endeavor simply because if you strive to be good at something, it will help you grow as a person. From my personal experience, pursuing a personal goal has helped other people in this world.

Human nature is to endeavor personal pursuit. If you assume that human nature is to endeavor advancing the common good, then you're going to get screwed by someone who endeavors personal pursuit.

It is easier to get most people to endeavor personal pursuit than it is to get most people to endeavor advancing the common good; which is why communism failed.

For example in your job your not going to try to make another employe, your going to try to make yourself look good so that you will get more money.
arg33115_arg33088	a1	I think i will go with personal persuit because no matter what we do we think of ourself first. I think its the human nature.But personal pursuit does not mean being selfish and only caring about oneself.I need to think about me first,success and then think of others. Everyone does think of themselves before thinking about others. First i need to make me happy to make others happy. This way i can make my life better and be who i am.	I feel like it is better to do both, but in order to help others you need to help yourself. It all starts with your personal goals before you can help others.
arg33058_arg33102	a1	I believe that personal pursuit is better because one must themselves happy before they can go out into the world and try to make everyone else happy. If you try to make everyone else happy and you leave no time for you, then you become a wreak and then you have no happiness in your life. Some people find that helping others is their own pursuit of happiness.	Unfortunately it is human nature to be selfish. This doesn't always mean that you are going to be a mean person and always do what is best for you, but an individual will usually help himself first. Sometimes in a good situation going out on your own personal pursuit does advance the common good. Neither is necessarily better but I believe that a personal pursuit might be more useful we only live this life for so long and we want to be the best we can be. Maybe your personal pursuit is to advance the common good.
arg33173_arg33149	a1	A personal pursuit is more important to me, because every person is responsible for themselves and their own actions. Advancing the common good would just mean that one or two people may not have to work as hard as you would for the same thing because of something you may have done. A personal pursuit can never be inequal. You'll always be able to dig yourself as deep into a hole as you want to, but standing as one person rather than many, you could probably dig faster if you were alone.	At the moment, I would have to choose a Personal Pursuit, I have goals set and would like to have them accomplished before I can begin to help others. Although I do enjoy helping others, it is "I" who I must help first.
arg33091_arg33073	a1	A personal pursuit of mine has always been to be the best pole vaulter that I can be, or the best at anything you do. I have learned that while trying to achieve this personal goal I have learned so much about trying to be a more responsible and more obedient. I believe in pursuing personal pursuit and personal goals is a better endeavor simply because if you strive to be good at something, it will help you grow as a person. From my personal experience, pursuing a personal goal has helped other people in this world.	I believe a personal pursuit is better for me because I'm more of a selfish person. I rather do something that is going to better my life, but every once in a while I do have my giving moments, so I guess it depends on how I am feeling. Right now I am going to go for the personal pursuit.
arg33165_arg33125	a2	Personal pursuit is better because its easier to help yourself then it is to help others. Plus not all people want to be helped. A persons' need is more important then others need, you need to your personal pursuits first. In this world you have to fight for what you want.	I think that focusing on a personal persuit comes first, going to college, having a career, and reaching a position of power. I don't think there really is a day when you will announce to the world that your going to advance the common good, but you can help people here and there, donating a little bit of time, donating a little money, but in the end if your ever in the position of power and have money you could truly advance the common good.
arg33086_arg33145	a1	A personal pursuit is a better endeavor because you are fulfilling something within yourself. It is important to help others but there is a time to do so. Achieving a personal goal is a journey to fulfillment where one is truly happy. Before helping others you must remember about yourself, but you must not forget about those who are really in need.	I feel that a personal pursuit is a better endeavor. Your personal pursuit should come first before anyone else's. But then again I really don't know, because if someone in your family is in need of something then you're going to do anything help that family member out. I believe that helping someone in your family is just something you do no matter what because they're blood. If someone who you don't know is in need at the same time as someone who is related to you, you're going to help the family member out instead of the random person you don't know.
arg33159_arg33054	a1	I believe that Personal pursuit is better because its more about you then it is about other people. if you cant focus on you personally how can you focus or help others around you. I'm not saying advancing the common good is bad at all. I'm just saying that its better to focus on yourself.	I believe personal persuit. Human nature is for someone to persue things for themselves, not for others.
arg33105_arg33158	a1	it is better to help yourself before you can help others. for instance, if you don't have your life together how are you going to help someone else with theirs. if your still living at home with your mother and you don't have a job and one want to help out by giving to an organization you couldn't do it. so basically you have to help yourself before you can help others.	Obviously everybody wants to say that they would help mankind, the world or save the city, but only a small percent of people would actually do this. I honestly would like to help mankind. I would like to save the world, but I'm posting under personal pursuit because I do not know what I would do in one of these situations. <br/> Anyway, if people did believe in the advancement of the common good all of the economical cars and factories wouldn't just now be made. These inventions would have come out as soon as the theory of global warming came out.
arg33146_arg33073	a1	Personal pursuit is better in my opinion. How are you going to reach common good if you cant better yourself. People may see that as being selfish but you cant help others if you cant help yourself.	I believe a personal pursuit is better for me because I'm more of a selfish person.

I thing personal pursuit because i believe that you have to help yourself first to accomplish your goals because how can you help someone if you dont help yourself. Helping yourself first would make you a better person and i think that after you achieve your goals and becoming a better person you would be able to help the common good.

arg33118_arg33121	a1	I believe personal pursuit its better, because its your job to decide what you want to do with your life. Your not always going to have someone by your side telling you whats right or wrong. Its all on you of reaching their goals. Its also a good thing to help other reach their succeed their goals.	Our animal insctinc is survival, its what makes us flinch wen we see something coming at ous it makes us react faster, our mental state changes.

arg33111_arg33115	a2	Honestly I believe that both are good there is no better in this arguement, because they both have that significance and they balance each other out. Personal pursuit because you improve your self for others and the enviorment around you, and then advancing the common good, because the goods help you and others improve. Life isn't perfect and we don't live in a perfect world and I don't expect it to be that way. These two are no different nor are they the same but they are significant.

For example, someone wants to succeed in life and through that he achieves his goals, whenever he is already succesful and with money he decides to help others.	In my personal opinion if you better yourself in the long run you can better the world. I mean you have to focus on yourself before you can take on the problems of the world and trying to fix them, or you will end up having a break down or something.

I think that evryone should be less selfish and do things that are "advancing the common good", but then again on the other hand we live in the real world and we are going to things that better benifit us. For example in your job your not going to try to make another employe, your going to try to make yourself look good so that you will get more money.
arg33091_arg33111	a1	A personal pursuit of mine has always been to be the best pole vaulter that I can be, or the best at anything you do. I have learned that while trying to achieve this personal goal I have learned so much about trying to be a more responsible and more obedient. I believe in pursuing personal pursuit and personal goals is a better endeavor simply because if you strive to be good at something, it will help you grow as a person. From my personal experience, pursuing a personal goal has helped other people in this world.	Honestly I believe that both are good there is no better in this arguement, because they both have that significance and they balance each other out. Personal pursuit because you improve your self for others and the enviorment around you, and then advancing the common good, because the goods help you and others improve. Life isn't perfect and we don't live in a perfect world and I don't expect it to be that way. These two are no different nor are they the same but they are significant.
arg33149_arg33142	a2	At the moment, I would have to choose a Personal Pursuit, I have goals set and would like to have them accomplished before I can begin to help others. Although I do enjoy helping others, it is "I" who I must help first.	Personally i think that if you are not helping yourself you cant help no one else. If you try to help every person that needs your help, they will just slow you down. Don't get me wrong helping people is always right. In the big picture if you pursuit your dreams and get rich, fame, and power you will be able to help the people that matter to you.
arg33143_arg33157	a2	I feel that a personal pursuit is a better endeavor. Your personal pursuit should come first before anyone else's. But then again I really don't know, because if someone in your family is in need of something then you're going to do anything help that family member out. I believe that helping someone in your family is just something you do no matter what because they're blood. If someone who you don't know is in need at the same time as someone who is related to you, you're going to help the family member out instead of the random person you don't know.	If i say that advencing the commen good is better then a personal pursuit, then i would be lieing to myself.

arg33102_arg33057	a2	Unfortunately it is human nature to be selfish. This doesn't always mean that you are going to be a mean person and always do what is best for you, but an individual will usually help himself first. Sometimes in a good situation going out on your own personal pursuit does advance the common good. Neither is necessarily better but I believe that a personal pursuit might be more useful we only live this life for so long and we want to be the best we can be. Maybe your personal pursuit is to advance the common good.	I feel like a personal pursuit is better. You can't help others around you if you can't help yourself.

arg33158_arg33126	a2	Obviously everybody wants to say that they would help mankind, the world or save the city, but only a small percent of people would actually do this. I honestly would like to help mankind. I would like to save the world, but I'm posting under personal pursuit because I do not know what I would do in one of these situations. <br/> Anyway, if people did believe in the advancement of the common good all of the economical cars and factories wouldn't just now be made. These inventions would have come out as soon as the theory of global warming came out.	Helping others for the common good can give you a feeling of pride but you have to have the means to be able to help the other person. To have those means you first have to have personal pursuit. I don't think one is better than the other but you first have to have personal pursuit before you can have common good. However for some people their personal pursuit can be the advancement of the common good.
arg33173_arg33159	a1	A personal pursuit is more important to me, because every person is responsible for themselves and their own actions. Advancing the common good would just mean that one or two people may not have to work as hard as you would for the same thing because of something you may have done. A personal pursuit can never be inequal. You'll always be able to dig yourself as deep into a hole as you want to, but standing as one person rather than many, you could probably dig faster if you were alone.	I believe that Personal pursuit is better because its more about you then it is about other people. if you cant focus on you personally how can you focus or help others around you. I'm not saying advancing the common good is bad at all. I'm just saying that its better to focus on yourself.

If you assume that human nature is to endeavor advancing the common good, then you're going to get screwed by someone who endeavors personal pursuit. Most Americans endeavor advancing the common good; which is why they get screwed by politicians who endeavor personal pursuit. If everyone endeavors personal pursuit, then we would keep each other in check. It is easier to get most people to endeavor personal pursuit than it is to get most people to endeavor advancing the common good; which is why communism failed.

arg33123_arg33086	a2	In order to help advance a common good, you must first realize what is your common good. You have to know when you are that better person to then spread your good to other people. You can't just assume that you are a great person if you don't have anything to show it. If you desire to see a world full of all this goodness, YOU have to be that spark that starts the fire.	A personal pursuit is a better endeavor because you are fulfilling something within yourself. It is important to help others but there is a time to do so. Achieving a personal goal is a journey to fulfillment where one is truly happy. Before helping others you must remember about yourself, but you must not forget about those who are really in need.

I think that no matter what you do everything comes back you even if your helping others, because you dont want your life to be out of whack helping others.
arg33173_arg33054	a1	A personal pursuit is more important to me, because every person is responsible for themselves and their own actions. Advancing the common good would just mean that one or two people may not have to work as hard as you would for the same thing because of something you may have done. A personal pursuit can never be inequal. You'll always be able to dig yourself as deep into a hole as you want to, but standing as one person rather than many, you could probably dig faster if you were alone.	I believe personal persuit. Human nature is for someone to persue things for themselves, not for others.
arg33054_arg33069	a2	I believe personal persuit. Human nature is for someone to persue things for themselves, not for others.	Human nature is to endeavor personal pursuit.

It is easier to get most people to endeavor personal pursuit than it is to get most people to endeavor advancing the common good; which is why communism failed.
arg33128_arg33086	a2	Well for me its a kind of a 50/50. I think that evryone should be less selfish and do things that are "advancing the common good", but then again on the other hand we live in the real world and we are going to things that better benifit us. For example in your job your not going to try to make another employe, your going to try to make yourself look good so that you will get more money.	A personal pursuit is a better endeavor because you are fulfilling something within yourself. It is important to help others but there is a time to do so. Achieving a personal goal is a journey to fulfillment where one is truly happy. Before helping others you must remember about yourself, but you must not forget about those who are really in need.
arg33115_arg33118	a1	I think i will go with personal persuit because no matter what we do we think of ourself first. I think its the human nature.But personal pursuit does not mean being selfish and only caring about oneself.I need to think about me first,success and then think of others. Everyone does think of themselves before thinking about others. First i need to make me happy to make others happy. This way i can make my life better and be who i am.	I believe personal pursuit its better, because its your job to decide what you want to do with your life. Your not always going to have someone by your side telling you whats right or wrong. Its all on you of reaching their goals. Its also a good thing to help other reach their succeed their goals.
arg33144_arg33158	a1	I thing personal pursuit because i believe that you have to help yourself first to accomplish your goals because how can you help someone if you dont help yourself. Helping yourself first would make you a better person and i think that after you achieve your goals and becoming a better person you would be able to help the common good.	Obviously everybody wants to say that they would help mankind, the world or save the city, but only a small percent of people would actually do this. I honestly would like to help mankind. I would like to save the world, but I'm posting under personal pursuit because I do not know what I would do in one of these situations. <br/> Anyway, if people did believe in the advancement of the common good all of the economical cars and factories wouldn't just now be made. These inventions would have come out as soon as the theory of global warming came out.
arg33123_arg33165	a1	In order to help advance a common good, you must first realize what is your common good. You have to know when you are that better person to then spread your good to other people. You can't just assume that you are a great person if you don't have anything to show it. If you desire to see a world full of all this goodness, YOU have to be that spark that starts the fire.	Personal pursuit is better because its easier to help yourself then it is to help others. Plus not all people want to be helped. A persons' need is more important then others need, you need to your personal pursuits first. In this world you have to fight for what you want.
arg33157_arg33126	a2	If i say that advencing the commen good is better then a personal pursuit, then i would be lieing to myself. Everyone wants to do good in the world, but the problem with that is that their is too many bad things happening in the world, and what you do wont really make a difference. A personal persuit does more for you then trying to advance the commen good in a world where you see very little good.	Helping others for the common good can give you a feeling of pride but you have to have the means to be able to help the other person. To have those means you first have to have personal pursuit. I don't think one is better than the other but you first have to have personal pursuit before you can have common good. However for some people their personal pursuit can be the advancement of the common good.
arg33145_arg33159	a2	I feel that a personal pursuit is a better endeavor. Your personal pursuit should come first before anyone else's. But then again I really don't know, because if someone in your family is in need of something then you're going to do anything help that family member out. I believe that helping someone in your family is just something you do no matter what because they're blood. If someone who you don't know is in need at the same time as someone who is related to you, you're going to help the family member out instead of the random person you don't know.	I believe that Personal pursuit is better because its more about you then it is about other people. if you cant focus on you personally how can you focus or help others around you. I'm not saying advancing the common good is bad at all. I'm just saying that its better to focus on yourself.
arg33057_arg33159	a1	I feel like a personal pursuit is better. You can't help others around you if you can't help yourself. If your personal pursuit is to make money for the needy or the common good, then it starts with you and your desire to make that money. A personal pursuit isn't always about money but it can also about happiness, love, and success.	I believe that Personal pursuit is better because its more about you then it is about other people. if you cant focus on you personally how can you focus or help others around you.

Unfortunately it is human nature to be selfish. This doesn't always mean that you are going to be a mean person and always do what is best for you, but an individual will usually help himself first. Sometimes in a good situation going out on your own personal pursuit does advance the common good. Neither is necessarily better but I believe that a personal pursuit might be more useful we only live this life for so long and we want to be the best we can be. Maybe your personal pursuit is to advance the common good.
arg33167_arg33143	a1	I believe that personal pursuit is better because in order to help others you have to help yoursel first. I also think that if you are happy with yourself and enjoy helping others you have the confidence and strength to help the outside world while satisfying yourself. For example, someone wants to succeed in life and through that he achieves his goals, whenever he is already succesful and with money he decides to help others.

People may see that as being selfish but you cant help others if you cant help yourself.

But then again I really don't know, because if someone in your family is in need of something then you're going to do anything help that family member out. I believe that helping someone in your family is just something you do no matter what because they're blood. If someone who you don't know is in need at the same time as someone who is related to you, you're going to help the family member out instead of the random person you don't know.
arg33142_arg33111	a1	Personally i think that if you are not helping yourself you cant help no one else. If you try to help every person that needs your help, they will just slow you down. Don't get me wrong helping people is always right. In the big picture if you pursuit your dreams and get rich, fame, and power you will be able to help the people that matter to you.	Honestly I believe that both are good there is no better in this arguement, because they both have that significance and they balance each other out. Personal pursuit because you improve your self for others and the enviorment around you, and then advancing the common good, because the goods help you and others improve. Life isn't perfect and we don't live in a perfect world and I don't expect it to be that way. These two are no different nor are they the same but they are significant.

I feel like a personal pursuit is better. You can't help others around you if you can't help yourself. If your personal pursuit is to make money for the needy or the common good, then it starts with you and your desire to make that money. A personal pursuit isn't always about money but it can also about happiness, love, and success.
arg33054_arg33091	a2	I believe personal persuit. Human nature is for someone to persue things for themselves, not for others.	A personal pursuit of mine has always been to be the best pole vaulter that I can be, or the best at anything you do. I have learned that while trying to achieve this personal goal I have learned so much about trying to be a more responsible and more obedient. I believe in pursuing personal pursuit and personal goals is a better endeavor simply because if you strive to be good at something, it will help you grow as a person. From my personal experience, pursuing a personal goal has helped other people in this world.
arg33069_arg33165	a1	Human nature is to endeavor personal pursuit. If you assume that human nature is to endeavor advancing the common good, then you're going to get screwed by someone who endeavors personal pursuit. Most Americans endeavor advancing the common good; which is why they get screwed by politicians who endeavor personal pursuit. If everyone endeavors personal pursuit, then we would keep each other in check. It is easier to get most people to endeavor personal pursuit than it is to get most people to endeavor advancing the common good; which is why communism failed.	Personal pursuit is better because its easier to help yourself then it is to help others. Plus not all people want to be helped. A persons' need is more important then others need, you need to your personal pursuits first. In this world you have to fight for what you want.
arg33128_arg33123	a2	Well for me its a kind of a 50/50. I think that evryone should be less selfish and do things that are "advancing the common good", but then again on the other hand we live in the real world and we are going to things that better benifit us. For example in your job your not going to try to make another employe, your going to try to make yourself look good so that you will get more money.	In order to help advance a common good, you must first realize what is your common good. You have to know when you are that better person to then spread your good to other people. You can't just assume that you are a great person if you don't have anything to show it. If you desire to see a world full of all this goodness, YOU have to be that spark that starts the fire.

I believe that personal pursuit is better because in order to help others you have to help yoursel first. I also think that if you are happy with yourself and enjoy helping others you have the confidence and strength to help the outside world while satisfying yourself. For example, someone wants to succeed in life and through that he achieves his goals, whenever he is already succesful and with money he decides to help others.

arg33125_arg33173	a1	I think that focusing on a personal persuit comes first, going to college, having a career, and reaching a position of power. I don't think there really is a day when you will announce to the world that your going to advance the common good, but you can help people here and there, donating a little bit of time, donating a little money, but in the end if your ever in the position of power and have money you could truly advance the common good.	A personal pursuit is more important to me, because every person is responsible for themselves and their own actions. Advancing the common good would just mean that one or two people may not have to work as hard as you would for the same thing because of something you may have done. A personal pursuit can never be inequal. You'll always be able to dig yourself as deep into a hole as you want to, but standing as one person rather than many, you could probably dig faster if you were alone.
arg33144_arg33165	a1	I thing personal pursuit because i believe that you have to help yourself first to accomplish your goals because how can you help someone if you dont help yourself.

From my personal experience, pursuing a personal goal has helped other people in this world.	Personally i think that if you are not helping yourself you cant help no one else. If you try to help every person that needs your help, they will just slow you down. Don't get me wrong helping people is always right. In the big picture if you pursuit your dreams and get rich, fame, and power you will be able to help the people that matter to you.
arg33073_arg33145	a2	I believe a personal pursuit is better for me because I'm more of a selfish person. I rather do something that is going to better my life, but every once in a while I do have my giving moments, so I guess it depends on how I am feeling. Right now I am going to go for the personal pursuit.	I feel that a personal pursuit is a better endeavor. Your personal pursuit should come first before anyone else's. But then again I really don't know, because if someone in your family is in need of something then you're going to do anything help that family member out. I believe that helping someone in your family is just something you do no matter what because they're blood. If someone who you don't know is in need at the same time as someone who is related to you, you're going to help the family member out instead of the random person you don't know.
arg33102_arg33167	a2	Unfortunately it is human nature to be selfish. This doesn't always mean that you are going to be a mean person and always do what is best for you, but an individual will usually help himself first. Sometimes in a good situation going out on your own personal pursuit does advance the common good. Neither is necessarily better but I believe that a personal pursuit might be more useful we only live this life for so long and we want to be the best we can be. Maybe your personal pursuit is to advance the common good.	I believe that personal pursuit is better because in order to help others you have to help yoursel first. I also think that if you are happy with yourself and enjoy helping others you have the confidence and strength to help the outside world while satisfying yourself. For example, someone wants to succeed in life and through that he achieves his goals, whenever he is already succesful and with money he decides to help others.

At the moment, I would have to choose a Personal Pursuit, I have goals set and would like to have them accomplished before I can begin to help others. Although I do enjoy helping others, it is "I" who I must help first.

In my personal opinion if you better yourself in the long run you can better the world.

I believe that Personal pursuit is better because its more about you then it is about other people. if you cant focus on you personally how can you focus or help others around you.

arg33125_arg33057	a1	I think that focusing on a personal persuit comes first, going to college, having a career, and reaching a position of power. I don't think there really is a day when you will announce to the world that your going to advance the common good, but you can help people here and there, donating a little bit of time, donating a little money, but in the end if your ever in the position of power and have money you could truly advance the common good.	I feel like a personal pursuit is better. You can't help others around you if you can't help yourself. If your personal pursuit is to make money for the needy or the common good, then it starts with you and your desire to make that money. A personal pursuit isn't always about money but it can also about happiness, love, and success.

I believe it is more important to have personal pursuit because if you even want to begin to help others you have to help yourself.

arg33128_arg33126	a2	Well for me its a kind of a 50/50. I think that evryone should be less selfish and do things that are "advancing the common good", but then again on the other hand we live in the real world and we are going to things that better benifit us. For example in your job your not going to try to make another employe, your going to try to make yourself look good so that you will get more money.

At the moment, I would have to choose a Personal Pursuit, I have goals set and would like to have them accomplished before I can begin to help others. Although I do enjoy helping others, it is "I" who I must help first.
arg33150_arg33086	a2	I think that personal pursuit is better because i think that helping yourself before others is natural. I think that no matter what you do everything comes back you even if your helping others, because you dont want your life to be out of whack helping others.	A personal pursuit is a better endeavor because you are fulfilling something within yourself. It is important to help others but there is a time to do so. Achieving a personal goal is a journey to fulfillment where one is truly happy. Before helping others you must remember about yourself, but you must not forget about those who are really in need.
arg33167_arg33142	a1	I believe that personal pursuit is better because in order to help others you have to help yoursel first. I also think that if you are happy with yourself and enjoy helping others you have the confidence and strength to help the outside world while satisfying yourself. For example, someone wants to succeed in life and through that he achieves his goals, whenever he is already succesful and with money he decides to help others.	Personally i think that if you are not helping yourself you cant help no one else. If you try to help every person that needs your help, they will just slow you down. Don't get me wrong helping people is always right. In the big picture if you pursuit your dreams and get rich, fame, and power you will be able to help the people that matter to you.
arg33101_arg33159	a2	Personal pursuit is better because people will be people and want to be the best they can be and they want to be on the top. I know I want to be a "winner". Which by this happening it means that someone has to be a loser. This is personal pursuit.	I believe that Personal pursuit is better because its more about you then it is about other people. if you cant focus on you personally how can you focus or help others around you.

This doesn't always mean that you are going to be a mean person and always do what is best for you, but an individual will usually help himself first.

Neither is necessarily better but I believe that a personal pursuit might be more useful we only live this life for so long and we want to be the best we can be. Maybe your personal pursuit is to advance the common good.	A personal pursuit of mine has always been to be the best pole vaulter that I can be, or the best at anything you do.

arg33054_arg33088	a2	I believe personal persuit. Human nature is for someone to persue things for themselves, not for others.	I feel like it is better to do both, but in order to help others you need to help yourself. It all starts with your personal goals before you can help others.
arg33118_arg33167	a2	I believe personal pursuit its better, because its your job to decide what you want to do with your life. Your not always going to have someone by your side telling you whats right or wrong. Its all on you of reaching their goals. Its also a good thing to help other reach their succeed their goals.	I believe that personal pursuit is better because in order to help others you have to help yoursel first. I also think that if you are happy with yourself and enjoy helping others you have the confidence and strength to help the outside world while satisfying yourself. For example, someone wants to succeed in life and through that he achieves his goals, whenever he is already succesful and with money he decides to help others.
arg33057_arg33101	a1	I feel like a personal pursuit is better. You can't help others around you if you can't help yourself. If your personal pursuit is to make money for the needy or the common good, then it starts with you and your desire to make that money. A personal pursuit isn't always about money but it can also about happiness, love, and success.	Personal pursuit is better because people will be people and want to be the best they can be and they want to be on the top. I know I want to be a "winner". Which by this happening it means that someone has to be a loser. This is personal pursuit.
arg33149_arg33144	a2	At the moment, I would have to choose a Personal Pursuit, I have goals set and would like to have them accomplished before I can begin to help others. Although I do enjoy helping others, it is "I" who I must help first.	I thing personal pursuit because i believe that you have to help yourself first to accomplish your goals because how can you help someone if you dont help yourself. Helping yourself first would make you a better person and i think that after you achieve your goals and becoming a better person you would be able to help the common good.
arg33091_arg33058	a1	A personal pursuit of mine has always been to be the best pole vaulter that I can be, or the best at anything you do. I have learned that while trying to achieve this personal goal I have learned so much about trying to be a more responsible and more obedient. I believe in pursuing personal pursuit and personal goals is a better endeavor simply because if you strive to be good at something, it will help you grow as a person. From my personal experience, pursuing a personal goal has helped other people in this world.	I believe that personal pursuit is better because one must themselves happy before they can go out into the world and try to make everyone else happy. If you try to make everyone else happy and you leave no time for you, then you become a wreak and then you have no happiness in your life. Some people find that helping others is their own pursuit of happiness.
arg33157_arg33102	a2	If i say that advencing the commen good is better then a personal pursuit, then i would be lieing to myself. Everyone wants to do good in the world, but the problem with that is that their is too many bad things happening in the world, and what you do wont really make a difference. A personal persuit does more for you then trying to advance the commen good in a world where you see very little good.	Unfortunately it is human nature to be selfish. This doesn't always mean that you are going to be a mean person and always do what is best for you, but an individual will usually help himself first. Sometimes in a good situation going out on your own personal pursuit does advance the common good. Neither is necessarily better but I believe that a personal pursuit might be more useful we only live this life for so long and we want to be the best we can be. Maybe your personal pursuit is to advance the common good.
arg33125_arg33102	a1	I think that focusing on a personal persuit comes first, going to college, having a career, and reaching a position of power. I don't think there really is a day when you will announce to the world that your going to advance the common good, but you can help people here and there, donating a little bit of time, donating a little money, but in the end if your ever in the position of power and have money you could truly advance the common good.	Unfortunately it is human nature to be selfish. This doesn't always mean that you are going to be a mean person and always do what is best for you, but an individual will usually help himself first.

I believe in pursuing personal pursuit and personal goals is a better endeavor simply because if you strive to be good at something, it will help you grow as a person. From my personal experience, pursuing a personal goal has helped other people in this world.	Well for me its a kind of a 50/50. I think that evryone should be less selfish and do things that are "advancing the common good", but then again on the other hand we live in the real world and we are going to things that better benifit us. For example in your job your not going to try to make another employe, your going to try to make yourself look good so that you will get more money.
arg33127_arg33115	a2	I think that personal pursuit is more important because in order to help others you have to help yourself first. At the time it may seem selfish but once that you get to a point that you are good at what your doing then you can help others do the same. So not only are you helping yourself but you are also helping others.	I think i will go with personal persuit because no matter what we do we think of ourself first. I think its the human nature.But personal pursuit does not mean being selfish and only caring about oneself.I need to think about me first,success and then think of others. Everyone does think of themselves before thinking about others. First i need to make me happy to make others happy. This way i can make my life better and be who i am.
arg33159_arg33102	a2	I believe that Personal pursuit is better because its more about you then it is about other people. if you cant focus on you personally how can you focus or help others around you. I'm not saying advancing the common good is bad at all. I'm just saying that its better to focus on yourself.	Unfortunately it is human nature to be selfish. This doesn't always mean that you are going to be a mean person and always do what is best for you, but an individual will usually help himself first.

arg33173_arg33102	a1	A personal pursuit is more important to me, because every person is responsible for themselves and their own actions. Advancing the common good would just mean that one or two people may not have to work as hard as you would for the same thing because of something you may have done. A personal pursuit can never be inequal. You'll always be able to dig yourself as deep into a hole as you want to, but standing as one person rather than many, you could probably dig faster if you were alone.	Unfortunately it is human nature to be selfish. This doesn't always mean that you are going to be a mean person and always do what is best for you, but an individual will usually help himself first.

How are you going to reach common good if you cant better yourself. People may see that as being selfish but you cant help others if you cant help yourself.
arg33165_arg33158	a2	Personal pursuit is better because its easier to help yourself then it is to help others. Plus not all people want to be helped. A persons' need is more important then others need, you need to your personal pursuits first. In this world you have to fight for what you want.	Obviously everybody wants to say that they would help mankind, the world or save the city, but only a small percent of people would actually do this. I honestly would like to help mankind. I would like to save the world, but I'm posting under personal pursuit because I do not know what I would do in one of these situations. <br/> Anyway, if people did believe in the advancement of the common good all of the economical cars and factories wouldn't just now be made.

arg33123_arg33126	a2	In order to help advance a common good, you must first realize what is your common good. You have to know when you are that better person to then spread your good to other people. You can't just assume that you are a great person if you don't have anything to show it. If you desire to see a world full of all this goodness, YOU have to be that spark that starts the fire.	Helping others for the common good can give you a feeling of pride but you have to have the means to be able to help the other person. To have those means you first have to have personal pursuit.

arg33111_arg33165	a2	Honestly I believe that both are good there is no better in this arguement, because they both have that significance and they balance each other out. Personal pursuit because you improve your self for others and the enviorment around you, and then advancing the common good, because the goods help you and others improve. Life isn't perfect and we don't live in a perfect world and I don't expect it to be that way. These two are no different nor are they the same but they are significant.	Personal pursuit is better because its easier to help yourself then it is to help others. Plus not all people want to be helped.
