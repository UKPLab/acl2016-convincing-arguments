arg35659_arg35686	a2	I think it's better to be fatherless because having someone to look up to, I'd rather choose no father than having a uncaring and lousy father there to be a stain in my life. I wouldn't look up to him and he doesn't necessarily have to be the fatherly figure I have to look up to.	Being fatherless would ensure that the only heartaches you have from him are his absence, and not knowing what he was like. A lousy father could come in gain your trust, and walk out on you. Some would like to believe that just knowing your father is there is enough. To me having a father who does nothing is in itself an absence because either way he knows nothing about you, and you nothing about him. I would rather him never exist than come in and out of my life.

I would love my dad but it just wouldn't be the same if you had a bad father that just keep bringing you problems. You dont have to have a father you can talk to someone else. Maybe its just because I am girl it would be easier for me to talk to my mother.

In my opinion it is better to be fatherless then to have a lousy father. I say this because if you have a lousy father than you have to deal with him and be ashamed of him. You would have to go day by day and know he is never going to be anything special, especially for you. But if you don't have a father you can always look up to someone else for that father figure.

Having a lousy father who tires to tell me what to but doesn't do anything with his life would just make me mad. Id rather be raised by my mother who is caring, loving, and actually does something with her life and works everyday to make money to put food on the table.
arg35718_arg35604	a1	Honestly, I'd rather be completely fatherless, not saying that not having is better than having one, albeit a lousy one. However, I do believe that you can grow up completely fatherless and without any major male role model and still be successful. Take myself for example; I lived the first thirteen years of my life without a father or any fatherly interaction, and those were the essential times a kid needed to be around his/her father, I turned out great(Self-opinion). So yes, as opposed to having a lousy father that would rub off on me and mold me into half a man, I would much rather being fatherless.	I think if i had a dad that did nothing for me i wouldnt want him around because odds are you and him arent going to be talking 5 years down the line anyway, so why try and make it work out if you already know what the outcome is.

I think it would be better fatherless the reason why is because i have never had a father in my life. I think that if you have a lousy father you will be taught to be lousy just like him. Parents are supposed to be setting examples for their kids, not just be lazy and that type of thing. Whats the point of having a bum for a father your whole life? you are not going to learn anything from him so why keep him? I feel like a mother can raise a son the same as a father can, well at least my mother did.
arg35748_arg35652	a1	Having a lousy father does not just leaves bumps, scrapes and scars externally. The damage goes much deeper. During those vital years of childhood having a bad dad isn't something that one forgets easily. Not only does it alter self confidence and self worth, it can covertly brand those bad habits in the mind of the child. The characteristics of an unfit parent are poisonous. I believe that it is better to be fatherless, rather than have a lousy father. Yes, it will take much effort to fill the shoes of the missing party, but it can and should be done.	I think it is better to be fatherless because a lousy father cannot do anything for the family.Imagine a father who is alcoholic and beats your mother, then you have no meaning of having a father.He creates violance and terror in the house and you alawys feel ashame to call him a father. It is better to be fatherless than to have a father who gives you a hard time.

arg35724_arg35679	a2	This argument could go both ways but I would have to agree with being fatherless because to me a lousy father is a father who is never there when you need him to be there or, he is never there to listen to what you have to say that's why being fatherless is better in my opinion because you can imagine your father to be whatever you want him to be and, it makes you a better person and a better father.

arg35758_arg35670	a1	I would rather be "fatherless" then having a "lousy father", because a "father" is supposed to be the man of the house and set a good example so the rest of the family can look up to him. So if I look up at a lousy father I might then be a lousy person, but if I had no father then I'll set the standards for my own self and step up and be the man of the house especially if I had younger brothers or sisters.	I would rather be fatherless than to have a lousy father. I would want a good role model to look up to and to talk to. Not someone who is never there.
arg35675_arg35718	a2	I rather be fatherless then having a lousy father because of this is that I wouldn't want to know how lousy he is and how bad he is of being a father. Being alone with just a mother is fine with me. It's just how I am. I wouldn't want to have a alcohlic father who drinks on the couch all day and curses my mother. It's just plain and simple, I have a good father or don't have a father at all even though he his still in the house, I wouldn't call him my father at all.	Honestly, I'd rather be completely fatherless, not saying that not having is better than having one, albeit a lousy one.

arg35669_arg35706	a2	Well, this is not an easy question to answer because both are kind of the same to me. But i would have to say fatherless because i'd rather have no man in my life than have somebody that isn't concerned about your life at all. To me that kind of is like being fatherless. I can always find another father figure or not even as much as a father figure, more like a male role model.	It really sucks not having a man to look up to while your growing up. I believe that being fatherless is better then having a lousy father. The reason I believe this is the best is because you dont want to be looking up to a guy that does nothing in life and its just setting bad examples. Who knows you might grow up following his steps. So being fatherless is better because from day one you start depending on your own with no need of a father being there. And theres always going to be other people by your side helping you get through life.
arg35604_arg35591	a2	I think if i had a dad that did nothing for me i wouldnt want him around because odds are you and him arent going to be talking 5 years down the line anyway, so why try and make it work out if you already know what the outcome is.	In my opinion, I believe it is better to be fatherless then to have a lousy father. I wouldnt know how it feel to have a lousy father but I have friends that there fathers are always drunk and never do anything to help them. They sometimes tell me they wish there dad wasn't around. Now if my dad was like that I would think the same because at least by not having a father you wouldnt know how it feels to be dissapointed by a father.

It can be either way, but I think being fatherless is better than having a lousy father because sometimes they get on your nerve and they make you do things you don't wanna do. But hey that's the way fathers' are. You still have other peoples to look up to even though your dad is not around. <br/> I'm used to being alone with my mom without my dad there because he passed away when I was six. So, I really don't have a favorite side.
arg35639_arg35671	a2	I thinks its better if you be a fatherless than a lousy father because your lousy father would give you bad influence. Maybe you might follow your father as he is. But if your a fatherless is gonna be ok but not good either because you might not like being a fatherless. As long as you a lousy father or fatherless so they can encourage you to success in life and also help you correct your msitake that you had made.	This is just my opinion, but I think it would be better to be fatherless than to have a lousy father. I mean i was always tought that a true man should be someone respectable, honest, nd hard working, if he's not a that kind of man then he doesn't deserve to be a father in the first place. Besides just because you don't have a father that doesn't mean you can't have aa father figuer in you life.

A father is someone is always their for you. He's the one that teaches you how to throw a baseball, and comes to all of you baseball games. A father is someone that protects you from all the evils of the world. But if our father is someone that doesn't care about you and spends most of his time in his room, then how can you trust that man to protect you. A lousy father is someone that is someone that you have a hard time trusting. I would rather have no father, then a father that I cant even trust my life with.

I think in any case its better to have no father then to have a lousy father either way you still lose.

It's always better to have a respectable father figure in your life then to have a lousy father figure.
arg35755_arg35748	a2	I would support the fact of being fatherless then having a lousy father. Fathers most likely are supposed to be the provider for the household and solve the problems that comes in hand because his like the alpha male but if your lousy then what point is it for you to have around. Kids look towards their father as an example of how to be a man and to have responsibility's over the actions they make. so why not be fatherless when having a lousy father is the same thing.

I personally feel that it is better to be fatherless, rather than having a lousy father. I personally know what it is like . My father was very lousy. The last time I saw him was when I was thirteen, and i havn't heard from him since. It doesn't bother me because I don't know him, and because he's not around I am never set up for any disapointment. So I think that to be fatherless is much better.

Sometimes I wish I Had a Lousy Father but Yet Not having A Father is so much better. It's been Eighteen Years since I've seen my Father but if he doesn't care then why should I? If he wanted to be in My life he could've been in my life. But being Fatherless is not bad because I have My Mother and To me that's My Father. I would rather have a Father who want to pay attention to me and actually be supportive of me.

Besides just because you don't have a father that doesn't mean you can't have aa father figuer in you life.
arg35645_arg35659	a1	Many people struggle with being fatherless. It is a challenge but it allows them to be tough and dependant on themselves. Being fatherless is hard but when it comes down to it, it is better to be fatherless than to have a lousy father. If you had a lousy father, they teach you the wrong things and don't allow you to expand.	I think it's better to be fatherless because having someone to look up to, I'd rather choose no father than having a uncaring and lousy father there to be a stain in my life. I wouldn't look up to him and he doesn't necessarily have to be the fatherly figure I have to look up to.
arg35616_arg35718	a2	Although being fatherless is probably one of the biggest hardships, undesired by all. I would rather be fatherless, than to have to deal with someone who on a daily basis would frustrate me. At least when you have no knowledge of a father, you only ponder on it from time to time. On the other hand, a lousy father would be with you in your thoughts forever.	Honestly, I'd rather be completely fatherless, not saying that not having is better than having one, albeit a lousy one. However, I do believe that you can grow up completely fatherless and without any major male role model and still be successful. Take myself for example; I lived the first thirteen years of my life without a father or any fatherly interaction, and those were the essential times a kid needed to be around his/her father, I turned out great(Self-opinion). So yes, as opposed to having a lousy father that would rub off on me and mold me into half a man, I would much rather being fatherless.
arg35669_arg35686	a2	Well, this is not an easy question to answer because both are kind of the same to me. But i would have to say fatherless because i'd rather have no man in my life than have somebody that isn't concerned about your life at all. To me that kind of is like being fatherless. I can always find another father figure or not even as much as a father figure, more like a male role model.	Being fatherless would ensure that the only heartaches you have from him are his absence, and not knowing what he was like. A lousy father could come in gain your trust, and walk out on you. Some would like to believe that just knowing your father is there is enough. To me having a father who does nothing is in itself an absence because either way he knows nothing about you, and you nothing about him. I would rather him never exist than come in and out of my life.
arg35670_arg35706	a2	I would rather be fatherless than to have a lousy father. I would want a good role model to look up to and to talk to. Not someone who is never there.	It really sucks not having a man to look up to while your growing up. I believe that being fatherless is better then having a lousy father. The reason I believe this is the best is because you dont want to be looking up to a guy that does nothing in life and its just setting bad examples. Who knows you might grow up following his steps. So being fatherless is better because from day one you start depending on your own with no need of a father being there. And theres always going to be other people by your side helping you get through life.
arg35633_arg35652	a2	It can be either way, but I think being fatherless is better than having a lousy father because sometimes they get on your nerve and they make you do things you don't wanna do. But hey that's the way fathers' are. You still have other peoples to look up to even though your dad is not around. <br/> I'm used to being alone with my mom without my dad there because he passed away when I was six. So, I really don't have a favorite side.	I think it is better to be fatherless because a lousy father cannot do anything for the family.Imagine a father who is alcoholic and beats your mother, then you have no meaning of having a father.He creates violance and terror in the house and you alawys feel ashame to call him a father. It is better to be fatherless than to have a father who gives you a hard time.

I rather be fatherless then having a lousy father because of this is that I wouldn't want to know how lousy he is and how bad he is of being a father. Being alone with just a mother is fine with me. It's just how I am. I wouldn't want to have a alcohlic father who drinks on the couch all day and curses my mother.

It is a proven fact that if you're a girl, you'll look for someone to be your other half that's similar to your father. Having a lousy father, for a girl, would mean having a lousy boyfriend as well.

As long as you a lousy father or fatherless so they can encourage you to success in life and also help you correct your msitake that you had made.	Right Now, In My opinion to be fatherless. Trust me I Went through it. Sometimes I wish I Had a Lousy Father but Yet Not having A Father is so much better. It's been Eighteen Years since I've seen my Father but if he doesn't care then why should I? If he wanted to be in My life he could've been in my life. But being Fatherless is not bad because I have My Mother and To me that's My Father. I would rather have a Father who want to pay attention to me and actually be supportive of me.

I think that if you have a lousy father you will be taught to be lousy just like him. Parents are supposed to be setting examples for their kids, not just be lazy and that type of thing. Whats the point of having a bum for a father your whole life? you are not going to learn anything from him so why keep him? I feel like a mother can raise a son the same as a father can, well at least my mother did.	As a young boy you grow hoping and that they have a father figure in there life to be there when he is needed. The last thing they need is someone who lives with you and doesn't do anything to help you learn the ways of life and answer questions you may need to know for life. As a young man it is important that you have someone in your life to support you and push you to be successful in life.

During those vital years of childhood having a bad dad isn't something that one forgets easily. Not only does it alter self confidence and self worth, it can covertly brand those bad habits in the mind of the child. The characteristics of an unfit parent are poisonous. I believe that it is better to be fatherless, rather than have a lousy father. Yes, it will take much effort to fill the shoes of the missing party, but it can and should be done.	Being fatherless would ensure that the only heartaches you have from him are his absence, and not knowing what he was like. A lousy father could come in gain your trust, and walk out on you. Some would like to believe that just knowing your father is there is enough. To me having a father who does nothing is in itself an absence because either way he knows nothing about you, and you nothing about him.

He's the one that teaches you how to throw a baseball, and comes to all of you baseball games. A father is someone that protects you from all the evils of the world. But if our father is someone that doesn't care about you and spends most of his time in his room, then how can you trust that man to protect you.

arg35758_arg35748	a2	I would rather be "fatherless" then having a "lousy father", because a "father" is supposed to be the man of the house and set a good example so the rest of the family can look up to him. So if I look up at a lousy father I might then be a lousy person, but if I had no father then I'll set the standards for my own self and step up and be the man of the house especially if I had younger brothers or sisters.

arg35673_arg35633	a1	In my opinion it is better to be fatherless then to have a lousy father. I say this because if you have a lousy father than you have to deal with him and be ashamed of him.

It can be either way, but I think being fatherless is better than having a lousy father because sometimes they get on your nerve and they make you do things you don't wanna do. But hey that's the way fathers' are.

So, I really don't have a favorite side.
arg35713_arg35699	a1	I personally feel that it is better to be fatherless, rather than having a lousy father. I personally know what it is like . My father was very lousy. The last time I saw him was when I was thirteen, and i havn't heard from him since. It doesn't bother me because I don't know him, and because he's not around I am never set up for any disapointment.

Honestly, I'd rather be completely fatherless, not saying that not having is better than having one, albeit a lousy one. However, I do believe that you can grow up completely fatherless and without any major male role model and still be successful. Take myself for example; I lived the first thirteen years of my life without a father or any fatherly interaction, and those were the essential times a kid needed to be around his/her father, I turned out great(Self-opinion). So yes, as opposed to having a lousy father that would rub off on me and mold me into half a man, I would much rather being fatherless.

What is the point of having someone in your life that is lousy? A father should set a good example for their children. If the dad is lousy then he is teaching his kids that it is okay to be that way and not do anything with their life.

arg35645_arg35718	a2	Many people struggle with being fatherless. It is a challenge but it allows them to be tough and dependant on themselves. Being fatherless is hard but when it comes down to it, it is better to be fatherless than to have a lousy father. If you had a lousy father, they teach you the wrong things and don't allow you to expand.	Honestly, I'd rather be completely fatherless, not saying that not having is better than having one, albeit a lousy one. However, I do believe that you can grow up completely fatherless and without any major male role model and still be successful.

It would hurt me the most if i had a lousy father and not to care about me. In this case i am in the middle of this two choices, that is because i have a father but he is not here in this country, i understand him because he left back to our country for a great reason. But i still need him here to support me.	It really sucks not having a man to look up to while your growing up. I believe that being fatherless is better then having a lousy father. The reason I believe this is the best is because you dont want to be looking up to a guy that does nothing in life and its just setting bad examples. Who knows you might grow up following his steps.

It's just plain and simple, I have a good father or don't have a father at all even though he his still in the house, I wouldn't call him my father at all.	It can be either way, but I think being fatherless is better than having a lousy father because sometimes they get on your nerve and they make you do things you don't wanna do.

But being Fatherless is not bad because I have My Mother and To me that's My Father. I would rather have a Father who want to pay attention to me and actually be supportive of me.	A father is someone is always their for you. He's the one that teaches you how to throw a baseball, and comes to all of you baseball games. A father is someone that protects you from all the evils of the world. But if our father is someone that doesn't care about you and spends most of his time in his room, then how can you trust that man to protect you.

So yes, as opposed to having a lousy father that would rub off on me and mold me into half a man, I would much rather being fatherless.
arg35673_arg35679	a2	In my opinion it is better to be fatherless then to have a lousy father. I say this because if you have a lousy father than you have to deal with him and be ashamed of him. You would have to go day by day and know he is never going to be anything special, especially for you. But if you don't have a father you can always look up to someone else for that father figure.	Being fatherless would ensure that the only heartaches you have from him are his absence, and not knowing what he was like. A lousy father could come in gain your trust, and walk out on you. Some would like to believe that just knowing your father is there is enough. To me having a father who does nothing is in itself an absence because either way he knows nothing about you, and you nothing about him. I would rather him never exist than come in and out of my life.
arg35633_arg35670	a2	It can be either way, but I think being fatherless is better than having a lousy father because sometimes they get on your nerve and they make you do things you don't wanna do. But hey that's the way fathers' are. You still have other peoples to look up to even though your dad is not around. <br/> I'm used to being alone with my mom without my dad there because he passed away when I was six. So, I really don't have a favorite side.	I would rather be fatherless than to have a lousy father. I would want a good role model to look up to and to talk to. Not someone who is never there.
arg35737_arg35632	a2	I think both being fatherless and having lousy father is depressing. But for me i will prefer to be fatherless, because at least you know that being fatherless is a good reason for a father not to be around. It would hurt me the most if i had a lousy father and not to care about me. In this case i am in the middle of this two choices, that is because i have a father but he is not here in this country, i understand him because he left back to our country for a great reason. But i still need him here to support me.	It's better to be fatherless. Having a lousy father creates a bigger gap in your life than being fatherless. It is a proven fact that if you're a girl, you'll look for someone to be your other half that's similar to your father. Having a lousy father, for a girl, would mean having a lousy boyfriend as well. By having no father you don't have to worry about how terrible they are and all you have to do is ponder how amazing your dad could have been. Wondering what could have been is better than wondering how much better it could be.
arg35659_arg35718	a2	I think it's better to be fatherless because having someone to look up to, I'd rather choose no father than having a uncaring and lousy father there to be a stain in my life. I wouldn't look up to him and he doesn't necessarily have to be the fatherly figure I have to look up to.	Honestly, I'd rather be completely fatherless, not saying that not having is better than having one, albeit a lousy one. However, I do believe that you can grow up completely fatherless and without any major male role model and still be successful.

Having a lousy father does not just leaves bumps, scrapes and scars externally. The damage goes much deeper. During those vital years of childhood having a bad dad isn't something that one forgets easily. Not only does it alter self confidence and self worth, it can covertly brand those bad habits in the mind of the child. The characteristics of an unfit parent are poisonous. I believe that it is better to be fatherless, rather than have a lousy father. Yes, it will take much effort to fill the shoes of the missing party, but it can and should be done.
arg35670_arg35669	a2	I would rather be fatherless than to have a lousy father. I would want a good role model to look up to and to talk to. Not someone who is never there.	Well, this is not an easy question to answer because both are kind of the same to me. But i would have to say fatherless because i'd rather have no man in my life than have somebody that isn't concerned about your life at all. To me that kind of is like being fatherless. I can always find another father figure or not even as much as a father figure, more like a male role model.
arg35639_arg35724	a2	I thinks its better if you be a fatherless than a lousy father because your lousy father would give you bad influence. Maybe you might follow your father as he is. But if your a fatherless is gonna be ok but not good either because you might not like being a fatherless. As long as you a lousy father or fatherless so they can encourage you to success in life and also help you correct your msitake that you had made.	This argument could go both ways but I would have to agree with being fatherless because to me a lousy father is a father who is never there when you need him to be there or, he is never there to listen to what you have to say that's why being fatherless is better in my opinion because you can imagine your father to be whatever you want him to be and, it makes you a better person and a better father.

I would love my dad but it just wouldn't be the same if you had a bad father that just keep bringing you problems. You dont have to have a father you can talk to someone else. Maybe its just because I am girl it would be easier for me to talk to my mother.
arg35645_arg35604	a1	Many people struggle with being fatherless. It is a challenge but it allows them to be tough and dependant on themselves. Being fatherless is hard but when it comes down to it, it is better to be fatherless than to have a lousy father. If you had a lousy father, they teach you the wrong things and don't allow you to expand.	I think if i had a dad that did nothing for me i wouldnt want him around because odds are you and him arent going to be talking 5 years down the line anyway, so why try and make it work out if you already know what the outcome is.

This is just my opinion, but I think it would be better to be fatherless than to have a lousy father. I mean i was always tought that a true man should be someone respectable, honest, nd hard working, if he's not a that kind of man then he doesn't deserve to be a father in the first place. Besides just because you don't have a father that doesn't mean you can't have aa father figuer in you life.

So, I really don't have a favorite side.	I would rather be "fatherless" then having a "lousy father", because a "father" is supposed to be the man of the house and set a good example so the rest of the family can look up to him. So if I look up at a lousy father I might then be a lousy person, but if I had no father then I'll set the standards for my own self and step up and be the man of the house especially if I had younger brothers or sisters.

A father is someone that protects you from all the evils of the world. But if our father is someone that doesn't care about you and spends most of his time in his room, then how can you trust that man to protect you.

In my opinion, I believe it is better to be fatherless then to have a lousy father. I wouldnt know how it feel to have a lousy father but I have friends that there fathers are always drunk and never do anything to help them. They sometimes tell me they wish there dad wasn't around.

arg35680_arg35645	a1	Being fatherless would ensure that the only heartaches you have from him are his absence, and not knowing what he was like. A lousy father could come in gain your trust, and walk out on you. Some would like to believe that just knowing your father is there is enough. To me having a father who does nothing is in itself an absence because either way he knows nothing about you, and you nothing about him. I would rather him never exist than come in and out of my life.	Many people struggle with being fatherless. It is a challenge but it allows them to be tough and dependant on themselves. Being fatherless is hard but when it comes down to it, it is better to be fatherless than to have a lousy father. If you had a lousy father, they teach you the wrong things and don't allow you to expand.
arg35733_arg35673	a2	Right Now, In My opinion to be fatherless. Trust me I Went through it. Sometimes I wish I Had a Lousy Father but Yet Not having A Father is so much better. It's been Eighteen Years since I've seen my Father but if he doesn't care then why should I? If he wanted to be in My life he could've been in my life. But being Fatherless is not bad because I have My Mother and To me that's My Father. I would rather have a Father who want to pay attention to me and actually be supportive of me.	In my opinion it is better to be fatherless then to have a lousy father. I say this because if you have a lousy father than you have to deal with him and be ashamed of him. You would have to go day by day and know he is never going to be anything special, especially for you. But if you don't have a father you can always look up to someone else for that father figure.
arg35724_arg35678	a2	This argument could go both ways but I would have to agree with being fatherless because to me a lousy father is a father who is never there when you need him to be there or, he is never there to listen to what you have to say that's why being fatherless is better in my opinion because you can imagine your father to be whatever you want him to be and, it makes you a better person and a better father.	As a young boy you grow hoping and that they have a father figure in there life to be there when he is needed. The last thing they need is someone who lives with you and doesn't do anything to help you learn the ways of life and answer questions you may need to know for life. As a young man it is important that you have someone in your life to support you and push you to be successful in life.
arg35755_arg35606	a2	I would support the fact of being fatherless then having a lousy father. Fathers most likely are supposed to be the provider for the household and solve the problems that comes in hand because his like the alpha male but if your lousy then what point is it for you to have around. Kids look towards their father as an example of how to be a man and to have responsibility's over the actions they make. so why not be fatherless when having a lousy father is the same thing.	I believe that both are bad but I would rather go fatherless. What is the point of having someone in your life that is lousy? A father should set a good example for their children. If the dad is lousy then he is teaching his kids that it is okay to be that way and not do anything with their life. If I got married and my husband was a lousy father, I would tell him he better step up and be the dad I know he can be or get out the house a never come back.

If you had a lousy father, they teach you the wrong things and don't allow you to expand.	I think both being fatherless and having lousy father is depressing. But for me i will prefer to be fatherless, because at least you know that being fatherless is a good reason for a father not to be around. It would hurt me the most if i had a lousy father and not to care about me. In this case i am in the middle of this two choices, that is because i have a father but he is not here in this country, i understand him because he left back to our country for a great reason. But i still need him here to support me.
arg35622_arg35591	a1	I think it would be better fatherless the reason why is because i have never had a father in my life. I think that if you have a lousy father you will be taught to be lousy just like him. Parents are supposed to be setting examples for their kids, not just be lazy and that type of thing. Whats the point of having a bum for a father your whole life? you are not going to learn anything from him so why keep him? I feel like a mother can raise a son the same as a father can, well at least my mother did.	In my opinion, I believe it is better to be fatherless then to have a lousy father. I wouldnt know how it feel to have a lousy father but I have friends that there fathers are always drunk and never do anything to help them. They sometimes tell me they wish there dad wasn't around. Now if my dad was like that I would think the same because at least by not having a father you wouldnt know how it feels to be dissapointed by a father.
arg35675_arg35678	a2	I rather be fatherless then having a lousy father because of this is that I wouldn't want to know how lousy he is and how bad he is of being a father. Being alone with just a mother is fine with me. It's just how I am. I wouldn't want to have a alcohlic father who drinks on the couch all day and curses my mother. It's just plain and simple, I have a good father or don't have a father at all even though he his still in the house, I wouldn't call him my father at all.

arg35639_arg35633	a1	I thinks its better if you be a fatherless than a lousy father because your lousy father would give you bad influence. Maybe you might follow your father as he is. But if your a fatherless is gonna be ok but not good either because you might not like being a fatherless. As long as you a lousy father or fatherless so they can encourage you to success in life and also help you correct your msitake that you had made.	It can be either way, but I think being fatherless is better than having a lousy father because sometimes they get on your nerve and they make you do things you don't wanna do. But hey that's the way fathers' are. You still have other peoples to look up to even though your dad is not around. <br/> I'm used to being alone with my mom without my dad there because he passed away when I was six. So, I really don't have a favorite side.
arg35699_arg35616	a2	I would rather be father less it might sound bad but I dont want to think of my father as a lousy one. I would love my dad but it just wouldn't be the same if you had a bad father that just keep bringing you problems. You dont have to have a father you can talk to someone else. Maybe its just because I am girl it would be easier for me to talk to my mother.	Although being fatherless is probably one of the biggest hardships, undesired by all. I would rather be fatherless, than to have to deal with someone who on a daily basis would frustrate me. At least when you have no knowledge of a father, you only ponder on it from time to time. On the other hand, a lousy father would be with you in your thoughts forever.
arg35632_arg35680	a1	It's better to be fatherless. Having a lousy father creates a bigger gap in your life than being fatherless. It is a proven fact that if you're a girl, you'll look for someone to be your other half that's similar to your father. Having a lousy father, for a girl, would mean having a lousy boyfriend as well. By having no father you don't have to worry about how terrible they are and all you have to do is ponder how amazing your dad could have been. Wondering what could have been is better than wondering how much better it could be.	Being fatherless would ensure that the only heartaches you have from him are his absence, and not knowing what he was like. A lousy father could come in gain your trust, and walk out on you.

However, I do believe that you can grow up completely fatherless and without any major male role model and still be successful. Take myself for example; I lived the first thirteen years of my life without a father or any fatherly interaction, and those were the essential times a kid needed to be around his/her father, I turned out great(Self-opinion). So yes, as opposed to having a lousy father that would rub off on me and mold me into half a man, I would much rather being fatherless.
arg35706_arg35675	a1	It really sucks not having a man to look up to while your growing up. I believe that being fatherless is better then having a lousy father.

arg35686_arg35639	a1	Being fatherless would ensure that the only heartaches you have from him are his absence, and not knowing what he was like. A lousy father could come in gain your trust, and walk out on you. Some would like to believe that just knowing your father is there is enough. To me having a father who does nothing is in itself an absence because either way he knows nothing about you, and you nothing about him. I would rather him never exist than come in and out of my life.	I thinks its better if you be a fatherless than a lousy father because your lousy father would give you bad influence.

arg35675_arg35659	a2	I rather be fatherless then having a lousy father because of this is that I wouldn't want to know how lousy he is and how bad he is of being a father. Being alone with just a mother is fine with me. It's just how I am. I wouldn't want to have a alcohlic father who drinks on the couch all day and curses my mother. It's just plain and simple, I have a good father or don't have a father at all even though he his still in the house, I wouldn't call him my father at all.	I think it's better to be fatherless because having someone to look up to, I'd rather choose no father than having a uncaring and lousy father there to be a stain in my life. I wouldn't look up to him and he doesn't necessarily have to be the fatherly figure I have to look up to.
arg35719_arg35705	a1	A father is someone is always their for you. He's the one that teaches you how to throw a baseball, and comes to all of you baseball games. A father is someone that protects you from all the evils of the world. But if our father is someone that doesn't care about you and spends most of his time in his room, then how can you trust that man to protect you. A lousy father is someone that is someone that you have a hard time trusting. I would rather have no father, then a father that I cant even trust my life with.	I think in any case its better to have no father then to have a lousy father either way you still lose. When you have a father you want him to be the best he can be so you can learn from him as you grow up. If you were to have a lousy father then whats the point of having a father at all if he's just going to be lousy and he wouldn't teach you anything. It's always better to have a respectable father figure in your life then to have a lousy father figure.
arg35671_arg35690	a1	This is just my opinion, but I think it would be better to be fatherless than to have a lousy father. I mean i was always tought that a true man should be someone respectable, honest, nd hard working, if he's not a that kind of man then he doesn't deserve to be a father in the first place. Besides just because you don't have a father that doesn't mean you can't have aa father figuer in you life.	Id rather be fatherless than to have a lousy father. Having a lousy father who tires to tell me what to but doesn't do anything with his life would just make me mad. Id rather be raised by my mother who is caring, loving, and actually does something with her life and works everyday to make money to put food on the table.
arg35669_arg35606	a2	Well, this is not an easy question to answer because both are kind of the same to me. But i would have to say fatherless because i'd rather have no man in my life than have somebody that isn't concerned about your life at all. To me that kind of is like being fatherless. I can always find another father figure or not even as much as a father figure, more like a male role model.	I believe that both are bad but I would rather go fatherless. What is the point of having someone in your life that is lousy? A father should set a good example for their children. If the dad is lousy then he is teaching his kids that it is okay to be that way and not do anything with their life. If I got married and my husband was a lousy father, I would tell him he better step up and be the dad I know he can be or get out the house a never come back.
arg35748_arg35639	a1	Having a lousy father does not just leaves bumps, scrapes and scars externally. The damage goes much deeper. During those vital years of childhood having a bad dad isn't something that one forgets easily. Not only does it alter self confidence and self worth, it can covertly brand those bad habits in the mind of the child. The characteristics of an unfit parent are poisonous. I believe that it is better to be fatherless, rather than have a lousy father. Yes, it will take much effort to fill the shoes of the missing party, but it can and should be done.	I thinks its better if you be a fatherless than a lousy father because your lousy father would give you bad influence. Maybe you might follow your father as he is. But if your a fatherless is gonna be ok but not good either because you might not like being a fatherless. As long as you a lousy father or fatherless so they can encourage you to success in life and also help you correct your msitake that you had made.
arg35633_arg35616	a2	It can be either way, but I think being fatherless is better than having a lousy father because sometimes they get on your nerve and they make you do things you don't wanna do. But hey that's the way fathers' are. You still have other peoples to look up to even though your dad is not around. <br/> I'm used to being alone with my mom without my dad there because he passed away when I was six. So, I really don't have a favorite side.	Although being fatherless is probably one of the biggest hardships, undesired by all. I would rather be fatherless, than to have to deal with someone who on a daily basis would frustrate me. At least when you have no knowledge of a father, you only ponder on it from time to time. On the other hand, a lousy father would be with you in your thoughts forever.
arg35604_arg35633	a2	I think if i had a dad that did nothing for me i wouldnt want him around because odds are you and him arent going to be talking 5 years down the line anyway, so why try and make it work out if you already know what the outcome is.

Having a lousy father creates a bigger gap in your life than being fatherless. It is a proven fact that if you're a girl, you'll look for someone to be your other half that's similar to your father. Having a lousy father, for a girl, would mean having a lousy boyfriend as well. By having no father you don't have to worry about how terrible they are and all you have to do is ponder how amazing your dad could have been. Wondering what could have been is better than wondering how much better it could be.
arg35591_arg35699	a1	In my opinion, I believe it is better to be fatherless then to have a lousy father. I wouldnt know how it feel to have a lousy father but I have friends that there fathers are always drunk and never do anything to help them. They sometimes tell me they wish there dad wasn't around. Now if my dad was like that I would think the same because at least by not having a father you wouldnt know how it feels to be dissapointed by a father.	I would rather be father less it might sound bad but I dont want to think of my father as a lousy one. I would love my dad but it just wouldn't be the same if you had a bad father that just keep bringing you problems. You dont have to have a father you can talk to someone else.

arg35678_arg35758	a1	As a young boy you grow hoping and that they have a father figure in there life to be there when he is needed. The last thing they need is someone who lives with you and doesn't do anything to help you learn the ways of life and answer questions you may need to know for life. As a young man it is important that you have someone in your life to support you and push you to be successful in life.	I would rather be "fatherless" then having a "lousy father", because a "father" is supposed to be the man of the house and set a good example so the rest of the family can look up to him. So if I look up at a lousy father I might then be a lousy person, but if I had no father then I'll set the standards for my own self and step up and be the man of the house especially if I had younger brothers or sisters.

I think it is better to be fatherless because a lousy father cannot do anything for the family.Imagine a father who is alcoholic and beats your mother, then you have no meaning of having a father.He creates violance and terror in the house and you alawys feel ashame to call him a father. It is better to be fatherless than to have a father who gives you a hard time.

It's always better to have a respectable father figure in your life then to have a lousy father figure.	Honestly, I'd rather be completely fatherless, not saying that not having is better than having one, albeit a lousy one. However, I do believe that you can grow up completely fatherless and without any major male role model and still be successful. Take myself for example; I lived the first thirteen years of my life without a father or any fatherly interaction, and those were the essential times a kid needed to be around his/her father, I turned out great(Self-opinion). So yes, as opposed to having a lousy father that would rub off on me and mold me into half a man, I would much rather being fatherless.

This argument could go both ways but I would have to agree with being fatherless because to me a lousy father is a father who is never there when you need him to be there or, he is never there to listen to what you have to say that's why being fatherless is better in my opinion because you can imagine your father to be whatever you want him to be and, it makes you a better person and a better father.
