43483_70668	a2	for everyone who is talking about RAPE in this subject let me ask you one thing!!!! if you got in a huge fight with someone and ended up breaking your hand or arm... would you cut it off just because it would REMIND you of that expirience??? <br/> if your actualy SANE you would say no and if you say yes you need to see a Physiatrist!!!!	There is only one situation in which I believe abortion is okay. <br/> If a mother is incapable of giving birth to the child, and attempting it might kill her, I believe abortion is sad, but necessary. <br/> Otherwise, no one has the right to kill a child, born or unborn.

28923_13268	a1	If someone is raped and ends up pregnant, they should have the choice to get an abortion or not.

30319_34485	a1	Statistics prove that less than 1% of women who are raped get pregnant because of the adrenalin rush. We have no right to take an unborn child's life. There are ways to avoid the situation of abortion. The woman can have the baby and give it up for adoption or raise it as their own because the woman is the still the child's biological mother. There are thousands of people on the waiting list for another baby to add to their family. DO NOT let anyone tell you otherwise because they obviously havn't been in the situation of adoption or abortion.	there isnt an excuse in the world to kill a fetus, a baby, a child, anyone. <br/> if the woman was raped, it most certainly is Not the baby's fault. the woman with the baby whoever they are should speak For the baby, and know that the baby would want to live.
75040_13270	a2	My one question... <br/> Why is it we argue for the "right" to kill the unborn when the government is taking away our real rights?	"If a women is raped" is a good argument. However why would you punish an innocent baby with the death penalty for some other man's crime. If the women does not want the child she could give it up for adoption. I just dont understand why you would kill the baby, the emotional trauma would happen without the baby as well.

59722_13268	a2	Well "The Champ" It is not the Woman's body we are talking about, it is a new life. And if you are going to be irresponsible dont let a new life die for it!	I argue for the rights of the child, who deserves the same right to life as the mother
80248_13276	a2	I am Pro-Life, <br/> Here is a question for anyone who is Pro-Choice: Is the baby in the mother's stomach living and if not how do you know?	we did not create the baby, we are not the ones who gave it life, why should we be the ones who put it to death, we have no authority to do such a thing.
59260_13270	a2	when people condemned consensual-cannibalism in africa, did they think of these people's right to their bodies? no. why should abortion be any different?	"If a women is raped" is a good argument. However why would you punish an innocent baby with the death penalty for some other man's crime. If the women does not want the child she could give it up for adoption. I just dont understand why you would kill the baby, the emotional trauma would happen without the baby as well.
54474_13269	a1	A growing embryo is considered human with the heartbeats initiating as early as 21st day of conception. So what if we cannot see the human form, it does have the potential to gain one. <br/> Around 60% of abortions are performed on never married women. Why can't women give the baby up for adoption instead, even if she is raped. If your raped does that give you the right to got out and kill someone?	Is personhood absolute or is it predicated upon position? <br/> If a premature baby is lying in an incubator or, let's say for the sake of argument, a 5 gallon pail, it is illegal to kill it. Why does the situation change so drastically just because the child is inside the womb?
13258_13256	a1	That situation is very rare and can usually be countered with a contraceptive drug if the woman seeks medical attention after the assault	I choose life <br/> Reagan once said something like this <br/> Notice that everyone who is pro choice has been born
13267_28923	a2	You are mixing topics thereby creating fallacy in your argument. The debate is not to determine under what circumstances may murder be morally acceptable, rather, the legal (some may say moral) foundation on which one can state that an individual has the right to terminate pregnancy. <br/> In addition, you may want to brush up on your etymology and vary your sources rather than simply paraphrasing definitions that fit your point of view.	If someone is raped and ends up pregnant, they should have the choice to get an abortion or not. If people are being irresponsible and have unprotected sex, they should be held accountable for their actions. Have the baby and put them up for adoption. Otherwise people are going to abuse their power to chose and will be killing babies because they are too lazy or ignorant to use protection.
13264_13300	a2	Don't kid yourself: the vast majority of abortions in this country are for reasons of convenience. If I was allowed to kill someone anytime they were inconvenient to me, I would be leaving a trail of bodies behind me when I walked down the street.	I'm pro-life based on one major fact.... abortion being used the way it is today.. like a last minute form of birth control. If your too stupid to wear protection, get on the pill, just give the baby up, there are thousands of people who can't have children who'd love to have it.
13277_34503	a2	the one whom bestows life, is the one whom bestows death	having some choices are good. but if you were in charge of all the choices in your life, the world would be in total chaos. i have always been pro life. and yes i do believe abortions should be illegal.

But I think it is by far the best choice.	if a woman gets raped and is left with the chil, she should put it up for adoption. if someone murders a pregnant women, they get charged for killing the woman and the fetus. People have the stupid excuss that it's not a baby, it's a fetus. if you look it up in the dictionary, it says that a fetus is an unborn baby.

If I was allowed to kill someone anytime they were inconvenient to me, I would be leaving a trail of bodies behind me when I walked down the street.	In Nebraska, it's legal to have an abortion by killing the baby while it's coming out of the womb. How can you argue against that?
75146_13303	a2	what we are dealing with is indirect murder if a women decides to abort a child she just had killed a life that may have been a big contribution to society	There should be no argument in this really...whatever way yu see a fetus...its still a living form that has been created in a very intimate way... you shouldn't be changing what mothernature or God or fate or whatever has decided for you...and if you didn;t wannna get preggo in the first place...don't have sex or use protection. <br/> Yeh there are some women that get raped and it's very unfortunate but they should give the child up for adoption. It's not the child's fault that it was created. So why should the goring being have to pay the ultimate price of it's life?
13257_1148434436	a1	Actually the government does tell women what they can and can't do with their bodies <br/> It's illegal to commit suicide <br/> If a person is caught trying to hack themselves to peices they could be placed in a mental institute <br/> So the government actually does limit what a woman can do with her body	What i dont undertsand is how people rationalize taking life it just doesnt make any sense... idc the situation in america how is killing leagal?

30319_13275	a1	Statistics prove that less than 1% of women who are raped get pregnant because of the adrenalin rush. We have no right to take an unborn child's life. There are ways to avoid the situation of abortion. The woman can have the baby and give it up for adoption or raise it as their own because the woman is the still the child's biological mother. There are thousands of people on the waiting list for another baby to add to their family. DO NOT let anyone tell you otherwise because they obviously havn't been in the situation of adoption or abortion.	"The government has no place to tell a woman what she can do with her own body, ever." <br/> The government DOES have that right. <br/> 1) a woman cannot legally prostitute herself in many states <br/> 2) a woman cannot take illicit drugs into her own body <br/> 3) a woman cannot use her body to murder others <br/> 4) a woman cannot use her body to steal <br/> 5) a woman cannot display her naked body in public <br/> there are many others. Men can also not do these things. <br/> The government tells us what to do with our bodies ALL THE TIME. This is no different.
13256_54558	a2	I choose life <br/> Reagan once said something like this <br/> Notice that everyone who is pro choice has been born	No matter what circumstance a woman is in SHE got herself pregnant!

They believe they have the right to get pregnant and then get rid of the baby because they feel like it and made a mistake. These are childrens lives we are talking about
70668_13257	a1	There is only one situation in which I believe abortion is okay. <br/> If a mother is incapable of giving birth to the child, and attempting it might kill her, I believe abortion is sad, but necessary. <br/> Otherwise, no one has the right to kill a child, born or unborn.
