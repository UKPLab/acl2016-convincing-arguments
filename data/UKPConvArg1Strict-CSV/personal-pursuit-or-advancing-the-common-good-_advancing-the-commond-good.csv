arg33060_arg33139	a1	I think that advancing the common good is better than personal pursuit. The reason for this is that it is better to help others than just to think about yourself. We need to improve our community first before we think about ourselves. If everyone tried to take care of their community then there would be no dangerous places.	There once was a rapper who said he was the people's Champ. When wanting to be successful sometimes you need to worry about the common good because that's what people want. I believe that advancing the common good is a better endeavor. Because when always thinking about your self and your personal pursuits you tend to become conceited and become an A hole. And an A jerk is a person that's not liked and when alone and not liked by others becomes lonely.
arg33090_arg33160	a1	I think common good is better than personal pursuit because its better to help other people. I feel good when i help people because it makes me feel happy that im doing something good in life.	Well me personally I think advancement of the common good is better. I don't really know how to back this up, I just know its the way i feel about the topic. I guess because I'm not a selfish person at all when it comes to anything. I believe in sharing and helping others out. So if there's something i have to sacrifice personally for the advance of the common good, 9 times out of 10 I'm going to do it.
arg33155_arg33114	a1	Advancing the Common good is a better endeavor than a personal pursuit. For example there are those who want to help others. A personal pursuit however is only for those selfish people who only care about themselves. The common good happens to some from a loan for college, to a charity for an orphanage, a school, etc	i believe they are diffenrent ways of feeling happy and proud of what you do, i feel happy helping others that doesnt means i help every person in front of me, i try to do what i think is best and good to make somebody happy.

We need to improve our community first before we think about ourselves. If everyone tried to take care of their community then there would be no dangerous places.	Well, I take the perspective of my parents, because of the way they try to make me, my brother, the rest of the family and friends happy. they would spend all of there money and time on others than themselves.
arg33092_arg33084	a2	I think the common good is a better endeavor, because it's better to give then to receive. It's better to give other people you're hand out in help then you holding your own hand.	Whether you are in a venture purely for yourself or others, you still end up affecting the people around you. <br/> When asking someone why they decide to help with the common good, the response would be something along the lines of, "it feels good to help out." <br/> Ultimately, people don't help out people unless they get some sort of satisfaction out of it, be it whether they community service hours, material rewards, fame, or just having the satisfaction of knowing that you have importance. So when helping out others, you make others feel good as well as yourself.

And an A jerk is a person that's not liked and when alone and not liked by others becomes lonely.	In my opinion, i think that advancing the common good is better because when helping others, not only is it appreciated by that person or people, but it makes you feel better as well. It doesn't mean that I won't spend time on myself, but if I have the opportunity to help others, I'll do my best to accomplish that.
arg33156_arg33090	a1	Everybody has goals and things that they want to accomplish in life. However, a person that helps the community and puts other people in front of themselves will most surely live a better life. If you really think about it, advancing the common good is basically a win-win situation. You get the support of other people, and you can also get recognition for yourself as a reward for your help.	I think common good is better than personal pursuit because its better to help other people. I feel good when i help people because it makes me feel happy that im doing something good in life.
arg33177_arg33135	a2	Well, I take the perspective of my parents, because of the way they try to make me, my brother, the rest of the family and friends happy. they would spend all of there money and time on others than themselves.	I think common good is better than personal pursuit because it's always better to assist other people. When people help each other out its more likely that everything comes out great. You get to become a role model by helping some one that needs your help. Yes personal pursuit is important when you are thinking of going to college. But than you got to think about leaving legacy behind by teaching other what you know. So the learning or society process can advance. So therefore you let others take it to the next level.
arg33047_arg33061	a1	In a perfect world, everyone would not be selfish and would use their talents and abilities for the good of humanity, but we don't live in a perfect world nor will we ever. I think that everyone has a God-given talent that can be used to better the world. If everyone put a little effort into improving society, our life would run a lot smoother. You can also combine the two if advancing the common good doesnt sound appealing to you. Their are plenty of jobs that do just that.	I think that advancing the common good is better because its helping out the community. But personal pursuit will be better because i know that if i dont go to college after high school then i wont go at all so i would choose my personal pursuit.

arg33103_arg33060	a2	I say the common good because of the type of forces that you can make as a whole group. like that person that says that by not voting they are not making a difference and when you look at the whole the population or percentage is bigger than of those who did vote. So if you want a good to be down and win you need more than yourself to win by looking for others with the same views.	I think that advancing the common good is better than personal pursuit.

When people do something for the good of others it helps them out in the long run. Whether it is a favor in return or anything else. In a personal pursuit you are just helping yourself. If we all just helped ourselves where would our world be? We all depend on others for help at some point. This world should be about others, not just me.	I strongly believe that helping yourself is not a selfish thing to do. If everyone took care of themselves and tried to make themselves better people then there would be no use of common good. You are the only person that knows what you feel, think and believe if you want change you would do change to yourself.
arg33147_arg33133	a1	In my opinion, i think that advancing the common good is better because when helping others, not only is it appreciated by that person or people, but it makes you feel better as well. It doesn't mean that I won't spend time on myself, but if I have the opportunity to help others, I'll do my best to accomplish that.	Well I'm kind of in the middle because i always think that helping people is a good thing and a way that you can get your blessings. But also sometime you have too help yourself be successful and make sure you can survive and provide. So to a certain extent it is good to help others but then its all about you.
arg33113_arg33075	a2	Benefiting yourself is always an assessable task but having a chance to better the common good only comes around once in a life time. You have to take into consideration that you can improve the lives or situations of the masses or just yourself. I believe that by advancing the common good you spread the wealth of nobility to others as well as yourself and that is the greatest benefit of all.	While striving to make advancements for the common good you can change the world forever. <br/> Allot of people have succeded in doing so. Our founding fathers, Thomas Edison, George Washington, Martin Luther King jr, and many more. These people made huge advances for the common good and they are honored for it.

Well personally I think that personal pursuit is better. No reason really, I just feel that I can help the people I care about most if im looking out for myself instead of the whole world. If i focus on my goals then someday I may be able to give my family what they have always dreamed about in return helping me even more.
arg33092_arg33134	a2	I think the common good is a better endeavor, because it's better to give then to receive. It's better to give other people you're hand out in help then you holding your own hand.	Usually my decision in the end is yes and no,or goes both ways. Today, however it is advancing for the common good. Making a decision to better suit yourself will help you for that moment, but in the long run who will it really help? Whereas, if you make an advancement for the common good you help yourself and other people. If you think about it we all want the world to be a "better place", and if you've noticed personal endeavors have gotten "us" into some not so happy predicaments.

arg33176_arg33141	a1	Advancing the common good is much better. From the very first day our parents or our teachers have taught us about team work. <br/> The whole point of doing community service is about the common good. We have to help others in order to help our selves.	I believe its best advancing towards the common good, but it doesn't really exist in this world. Mostly everyone is greedy, selfish, only would care about what they want, and not caring about what others would want. I believe everyone have small feeling towards the common good, but most people think they are important than anyone else in the whole world.

arg33162_arg33114	a1	This is planet Earth, shared by billions, not just you. If given the opportunity to advance the human race, every person alive should take it; choosing personal gain over advancing the common good is selfish. There's no other way around it. I don't want ot hear "it's human nature to be selfish" or any other lame excuse. The point is we all live together, and if your too greedy and self-centered to care about your surroundings and the individuals around you, your merely taking up space.	i believe they are diffenrent ways of feeling happy and proud of what you do, i feel happy helping others that doesnt means i help every person in front of me, i try to do what i think is best and good to make somebody happy.
arg33089_arg33129	a2	The ability to do both would be awesome, but since I have to choose I'd rather help others in any way I can.

I think advancing the common good would be better in the long run. I mean sure you can worry about yourself, but put it like this, "Your not the most important person in the world". If everyone just thought about just them and not about other people where would we be. Its better to put others first and think about yourself later then to put yourself first.

For example, football is a team sport they all have to believe in each other and not in their selves because there is no "I in Team", like the other night in the Super Bowl the Steelers couldn't score the winning drive in the last 2 minutes with out the lineman blocking for the quarterback, quarterback believing in the lineman, and the receiver believing in the quarterback to make a good pass.

Both endeavors are better to be part of.But I as an individual I would like to advance the common good in this society to become unpetty with each other,to do things way better than they use to.Everyone in this world knows what they want to be. To be alone pursuing their dreams without the help of others, but some other will help the community to make it safe and better.To teach them what they are capable of,to beleive in themselfs that they can do as the things wealthy people does.
arg33122_arg33103	a1	I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.

I think the common good is a better endeavor, because it's better to give then to receive. It's better to give other people you're hand out in help then you holding your own hand.
arg33133_arg33178	a2	Well I'm kind of in the middle because i always think that helping people is a good thing and a way that you can get your blessings. But also sometime you have too help yourself be successful and make sure you can survive and provide. So to a certain extent it is good to help others but then its all about you.	Advancing the common good is better because like the bible says "Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor." For example, football is a team sport they all have to believe in each other and not in their selves because there is no "I in Team", like the other night in the Super Bowl the Steelers couldn't score the winning drive in the last 2 minutes with out the lineman blocking for the quarterback, quarterback believing in the lineman, and the receiver believing in the quarterback to make a good pass. So we need each other and depend on each other to be great.
arg33049_arg33089	a1	Advancing the common good is always better than personal pursuit. If every person decided to advance the common good, then every person would see the effects of it. Of course, most people chose personal pursuit because they will benefit from it.	The ability to do both would be awesome, but since I have to choose I'd rather help others in any way I can. Even a little thing can impact someone's life, like being a friend or helping them with getting their needs to survive life.
arg33060_arg33090	a1	I think that advancing the common good is better than personal pursuit. The reason for this is that it is better to help others than just to think about yourself. We need to improve our community first before we think about ourselves. If everyone tried to take care of their community then there would be no dangerous places.	I think common good is better than personal pursuit because its better to help other people. I feel good when i help people because it makes me feel happy that im doing something good in life.

arg33135_arg33049	a1	I think common good is better than personal pursuit because it's always better to assist other people. When people help each other out its more likely that everything comes out great. You get to become a role model by helping some one that needs your help. Yes personal pursuit is important when you are thinking of going to college. But than you got to think about leaving legacy behind by teaching other what you know. So the learning or society process can advance. So therefore you let others take it to the next level.	Advancing the common good is always better than personal pursuit.

arg33134_arg33176	a1	Usually my decision in the end is yes and no,or goes both ways. Today, however it is advancing for the common good. Making a decision to better suit yourself will help you for that moment, but in the long run who will it really help? Whereas, if you make an advancement for the common good you help yourself and other people. If you think about it we all want the world to be a "better place", and if you've noticed personal endeavors have gotten "us" into some not so happy predicaments.	Advancing the common good is much better. From the very first day our parents or our teachers have taught us about team work. <br/> The whole point of doing community service is about the common good. We have to help others in order to help our selves.
arg33160_arg33162	a2	Well me personally I think advancement of the common good is better. I don't really know how to back this up, I just know its the way i feel about the topic. I guess because I'm not a selfish person at all when it comes to anything. I believe in sharing and helping others out. So if there's something i have to sacrifice personally for the advance of the common good, 9 times out of 10 I'm going to do it.	This is planet Earth, shared by billions, not just you. If given the opportunity to advance the human race, every person alive should take it; choosing personal gain over advancing the common good is selfish. There's no other way around it. I don't want ot hear "it's human nature to be selfish" or any other lame excuse. The point is we all live together, and if your too greedy and self-centered to care about your surroundings and the individuals around you, your merely taking up space.

In a perfect world, everyone would not be selfish and would use their talents and abilities for the good of humanity, but we don't live in a perfect world nor will we ever.

arg33139_arg33122	a2	There once was a rapper who said he was the people's Champ. When wanting to be successful sometimes you need to worry about the common good because that's what people want. I believe that advancing the common good is a better endeavor. Because when always thinking about your self and your personal pursuits you tend to become conceited and become an A hole. And an A jerk is a person that's not liked and when alone and not liked by others becomes lonely.	I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.

I think common good is better than personal pursuit because its better to help other people. I feel good when i help people because it makes me feel happy that im doing something good in life.

arg33084_arg33100	a1	Whether you are in a venture purely for yourself or others, you still end up affecting the people around you. <br/> When asking someone why they decide to help with the common good, the response would be something along the lines of, "it feels good to help out." <br/> Ultimately, people don't help out people unless they get some sort of satisfaction out of it, be it whether they community service hours, material rewards, fame, or just having the satisfaction of knowing that you have importance. So when helping out others, you make others feel good as well as yourself.	Well personally I think that personal pursuit is better. No reason really, I just feel that I can help the people I care about most if im looking out for myself instead of the whole world. If i focus on my goals then someday I may be able to give my family what they have always dreamed about in return helping me even more.
arg33147_arg33074	a1	In my opinion, i think that advancing the common good is better because when helping others, not only is it appreciated by that person or people, but it makes you feel better as well. It doesn't mean that I won't spend time on myself, but if I have the opportunity to help others, I'll do my best to accomplish that.

I believe everyone have small feeling towards the common good, but most people think they are important than anyone else in the whole world.	advancing the common good is better to me because, If i were to pursue my own personal pursuit, it wouldn't be all that good, because most of them would be selfish choices that woulld end up hurting someone else, i dont like hurting people. It would be a much better world if we thought about everyone else well being before we think about our selves.
arg33147_arg33162	a2	In my opinion, i think that advancing the common good is better because when helping others, not only is it appreciated by that person or people, but it makes you feel better as well. It doesn't mean that I won't spend time on myself, but if I have the opportunity to help others, I'll do my best to accomplish that.	This is planet Earth, shared by billions, not just you. If given the opportunity to advance the human race, every person alive should take it; choosing personal gain over advancing the common good is selfish. There's no other way around it. I don't want ot hear "it's human nature to be selfish" or any other lame excuse. The point is we all live together, and if your too greedy and self-centered to care about your surroundings and the individuals around you, your merely taking up space.

You have to take into consideration that you can improve the lives or situations of the masses or just yourself. I believe that by advancing the common good you spread the wealth of nobility to others as well as yourself and that is the greatest benefit of all.

So when helping out others, you make others feel good as well as yourself.	Everybody has goals and things that they want to accomplish in life. However, a person that helps the community and puts other people in front of themselves will most surely live a better life.

arg33135_arg33047	a1	I think common good is better than personal pursuit because it's always better to assist other people. When people help each other out its more likely that everything comes out great. You get to become a role model by helping some one that needs your help. Yes personal pursuit is important when you are thinking of going to college. But than you got to think about leaving legacy behind by teaching other what you know. So the learning or society process can advance. So therefore you let others take it to the next level.	In a perfect world, everyone would not be selfish and would use their talents and abilities for the good of humanity, but we don't live in a perfect world nor will we ever. I think that everyone has a God-given talent that can be used to better the world. If everyone put a little effort into improving society, our life would run a lot smoother. You can also combine the two if advancing the common good doesnt sound appealing to you. Their are plenty of jobs that do just that.

So we need each other and depend on each other to be great.	I strongly believe that helping yourself is not a selfish thing to do.

You are the only person that knows what you feel, think and believe if you want change you would do change to yourself.

Simply Written <br/> Seeking to advance the Common good <br/> allows doors to be opened and barriers to be <br/> broken, and after a journey (or) series of <br/> considerate acts one can have an less-difficult <br/> time Persuing a "Personal" goal or Lifestyle. <br/> The word for this debate is <br/> [sacrifice] <br/> How much would a person really "sacrifice" <br/> for his or her neighbor without being <br/> blinded by the light beemed from selfishness?? <br/> No matter where a person is in thier life.... <br/> Remember, you MAY NOT know what they did <br/> (or) WHAT they gave-up to be there!
arg33084_arg33133	a1	Whether you are in a venture purely for yourself or others, you still end up affecting the people around you. <br/> When asking someone why they decide to help with the common good, the response would be something along the lines of, "it feels good to help out." <br/> Ultimately, people don't help out people unless they get some sort of satisfaction out of it, be it whether they community service hours, material rewards, fame, or just having the satisfaction of knowing that you have importance. So when helping out others, you make others feel good as well as yourself.	Well I'm kind of in the middle because i always think that helping people is a good thing and a way that you can get your blessings. But also sometime you have too help yourself be successful and make sure you can survive and provide. So to a certain extent it is good to help others but then its all about you.
arg33135_arg33136	a1	I think common good is better than personal pursuit because it's always better to assist other people. When people help each other out its more likely that everything comes out great. You get to become a role model by helping some one that needs your help. Yes personal pursuit is important when you are thinking of going to college. But than you got to think about leaving legacy behind by teaching other what you know. So the learning or society process can advance. So therefore you let others take it to the next level.	I think advancing the common good would be better in the long run. I mean sure you can worry about yourself, but put it like this, "Your not the most important person in the world". If everyone just thought about just them and not about other people where would we be. Its better to put others first and think about yourself later then to put yourself first.
arg33134_arg33100	a1	Usually my decision in the end is yes and no,or goes both ways. Today, however it is advancing for the common good. Making a decision to better suit yourself will help you for that moment, but in the long run who will it really help? Whereas, if you make an advancement for the common good you help yourself and other people. If you think about it we all want the world to be a "better place", and if you've noticed personal endeavors have gotten "us" into some not so happy predicaments.	Well personally I think that personal pursuit is better. No reason really, I just feel that I can help the people I care about most if im looking out for myself instead of the whole world. If i focus on my goals then someday I may be able to give my family what they have always dreamed about in return helping me even more.
arg33141_arg33110	a1	I believe its best advancing towards the common good, but it doesn't really exist in this world. Mostly everyone is greedy, selfish, only would care about what they want, and not caring about what others would want. I believe everyone have small feeling towards the common good, but most people think they are important than anyone else in the whole world.	I strongly believe that helping yourself is not a selfish thing to do. If everyone took care of themselves and tried to make themselves better people then there would be no use of common good. You are the only person that knows what you feel, think and believe if you want change you would do change to yourself.

arg33119_arg33114	a1	I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.	i believe they are diffenrent ways of feeling happy and proud of what you do, i feel happy helping others that doesnt means i help every person in front of me, i try to do what i think is best and good to make somebody happy.
arg33061_arg33147	a2	I think that advancing the common good is better because its helping out the community. But personal pursuit will be better because i know that if i dont go to college after high school then i wont go at all so i would choose my personal pursuit.	In my opinion, i think that advancing the common good is better because when helping others, not only is it appreciated by that person or people, but it makes you feel better as well. It doesn't mean that I won't spend time on myself, but if I have the opportunity to help others, I'll do my best to accomplish that.
arg33162_arg33176	a2	This is planet Earth, shared by billions, not just you. If given the opportunity to advance the human race, every person alive should take it; choosing personal gain over advancing the common good is selfish. There's no other way around it. I don't want ot hear "it's human nature to be selfish" or any other lame excuse. The point is we all live together, and if your too greedy and self-centered to care about your surroundings and the individuals around you, your merely taking up space.	Advancing the common good is much better. From the very first day our parents or our teachers have taught us about team work. <br/> The whole point of doing community service is about the common good. We have to help others in order to help our selves.
arg33089_arg33177	a1	The ability to do both would be awesome, but since I have to choose I'd rather help others in any way I can.

Benefiting yourself is always an assessable task but having a chance to better the common good only comes around once in a life time.

So if there's something i have to sacrifice personally for the advance of the common good, 9 times out of 10 I'm going to do it.	Advancing the common good is better because like the bible says "Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor." For example, football is a team sport they all have to believe in each other and not in their selves because there is no "I in Team", like the other night in the Super Bowl the Steelers couldn't score the winning drive in the last 2 minutes with out the lineman blocking for the quarterback, quarterback believing in the lineman, and the receiver believing in the quarterback to make a good pass.

If we all just helped ourselves where would our world be? We all depend on others for help at some point. This world should be about others, not just me.

While striving to make advancements for the common good you can change the world forever. <br/> Allot of people have succeded in doing so. Our founding fathers, Thomas Edison, George Washington, Martin Luther King jr, and many more. These people made huge advances for the common good and they are honored for it.
arg33061_arg33110	a1	I think that advancing the common good is better because its helping out the community. But personal pursuit will be better because i know that if i dont go to college after high school then i wont go at all so i would choose my personal pursuit.	I strongly believe that helping yourself is not a selfish thing to do. If everyone took care of themselves and tried to make themselves better people then there would be no use of common good. You are the only person that knows what you feel, think and believe if you want change you would do change to yourself.
arg33134_arg33114	a1	Usually my decision in the end is yes and no,or goes both ways. Today, however it is advancing for the common good. Making a decision to better suit yourself will help you for that moment, but in the long run who will it really help? Whereas, if you make an advancement for the common good you help yourself and other people. If you think about it we all want the world to be a "better place", and if you've noticed personal endeavors have gotten "us" into some not so happy predicaments.	i believe they are diffenrent ways of feeling happy and proud of what you do, i feel happy helping others that doesnt means i help every person in front of me, i try to do what i think is best and good to make somebody happy.

I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.
arg33139_arg33089	a2	There once was a rapper who said he was the people's Champ. When wanting to be successful sometimes you need to worry about the common good because that's what people want. I believe that advancing the common good is a better endeavor. Because when always thinking about your self and your personal pursuits you tend to become conceited and become an A hole. And an A jerk is a person that's not liked and when alone and not liked by others becomes lonely.	The ability to do both would be awesome, but since I have to choose I'd rather help others in any way I can. Even a little thing can impact someone's life, like being a friend or helping them with getting their needs to survive life.

I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.	I think common good is better than personal pursuit because it's always better to assist other people. When people help each other out its more likely that everything comes out great. You get to become a role model by helping some one that needs your help. Yes personal pursuit is important when you are thinking of going to college. But than you got to think about leaving legacy behind by teaching other what you know. So the learning or society process can advance. So therefore you let others take it to the next level.
arg33178_arg33176	a1	Advancing the common good is better because like the bible says "Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor." For example, football is a team sport they all have to believe in each other and not in their selves because there is no "I in Team", like the other night in the Super Bowl the Steelers couldn't score the winning drive in the last 2 minutes with out the lineman blocking for the quarterback, quarterback believing in the lineman, and the receiver believing in the quarterback to make a good pass. So we need each other and depend on each other to be great.	Advancing the common good is much better. From the very first day our parents or our teachers have taught us about team work. <br/> The whole point of doing community service is about the common good. We have to help others in order to help our selves.
arg33082_arg33147	a2	Both endeavors are better to be part of.But I as an individual I would like to advance the common good in this society to become unpetty with each other,to do things way better than they use to.Everyone in this world knows what they want to be. To be alone pursuing their dreams without the help of others, but some other will help the community to make it safe and better.To teach them what they are capable of,to beleive in themselfs that they can do as the things wealthy people does.	In my opinion, i think that advancing the common good is better because when helping others, not only is it appreciated by that person or people, but it makes you feel better as well. It doesn't mean that I won't spend time on myself, but if I have the opportunity to help others, I'll do my best to accomplish that.
arg33092_arg33147	a2	I think the common good is a better endeavor, because it's better to give then to receive.

arg33060_arg33074	a1	I think that advancing the common good is better than personal pursuit. The reason for this is that it is better to help others than just to think about yourself. We need to improve our community first before we think about ourselves. If everyone tried to take care of their community then there would be no dangerous places.	Simply Written <br/> Seeking to advance the Common good <br/> allows doors to be opened and barriers to be <br/> broken, and after a journey (or) series of <br/> considerate acts one can have an less-difficult <br/> time Persuing a "Personal" goal or Lifestyle. <br/> The word for this debate is <br/> [sacrifice] <br/> How much would a person really "sacrifice" <br/> for his or her neighbor without being <br/> blinded by the light beemed from selfishness?? <br/> No matter where a person is in thier life.... <br/> Remember, you MAY NOT know what they did <br/> (or) WHAT they gave-up to be there!

arg33129_arg33160	a1	I volunteer at Irving Cares, and when I do I feel so great that I can help the community. To me when I help advance the common good I am helping myself. When people do something for the good of others it helps them out in the long run. Whether it is a favor in return or anything else. In a personal pursuit you are just helping yourself. If we all just helped ourselves where would our world be? We all depend on others for help at some point. This world should be about others, not just me.	Well me personally I think advancement of the common good is better. I don't really know how to back this up, I just know its the way i feel about the topic. I guess because I'm not a selfish person at all when it comes to anything. I believe in sharing and helping others out. So if there's something i have to sacrifice personally for the advance of the common good, 9 times out of 10 I'm going to do it.

Advancing the Common good is a better endeavor than a personal pursuit. For example there are those who want to help others. A personal pursuit however is only for those selfish people who only care about themselves. The common good happens to some from a loan for college, to a charity for an orphanage, a school, etc
arg33049_arg33139	a1	Advancing the common good is always better than personal pursuit. If every person decided to advance the common good, then every person would see the effects of it. Of course, most people chose personal pursuit because they will benefit from it.	There once was a rapper who said he was the people's Champ. When wanting to be successful sometimes you need to worry about the common good because that's what people want. I believe that advancing the common good is a better endeavor. Because when always thinking about your self and your personal pursuits you tend to become conceited and become an A hole. And an A jerk is a person that's not liked and when alone and not liked by others becomes lonely.
arg33131_arg33129	a2	I think advancing the common good is better, because it will eventually come back to you anyways. If you better the world somehow, it will also help you out in some way.

arg33162_arg33177	a1	This is planet Earth, shared by billions, not just you. If given the opportunity to advance the human race, every person alive should take it; choosing personal gain over advancing the common good is selfish. There's no other way around it. I don't want ot hear "it's human nature to be selfish" or any other lame excuse. The point is we all live together, and if your too greedy and self-centered to care about your surroundings and the individuals around you, your merely taking up space.	Well, I take the perspective of my parents, because of the way they try to make me, my brother, the rest of the family and friends happy. they would spend all of there money and time on others than themselves.

arg33047_arg33133	a1	In a perfect world, everyone would not be selfish and would use their talents and abilities for the good of humanity, but we don't live in a perfect world nor will we ever. I think that everyone has a God-given talent that can be used to better the world. If everyone put a little effort into improving society, our life would run a lot smoother. You can also combine the two if advancing the common good doesnt sound appealing to you. Their are plenty of jobs that do just that.	Well I'm kind of in the middle because i always think that helping people is a good thing and a way that you can get your blessings. But also sometime you have too help yourself be successful and make sure you can survive and provide. So to a certain extent it is good to help others but then its all about you.
arg33103_arg33178	a2	I say the common good because of the type of forces that you can make as a whole group. like that person that says that by not voting they are not making a difference and when you look at the whole the population or percentage is bigger than of those who did vote. So if you want a good to be down and win you need more than yourself to win by looking for others with the same views.

Well I'm kind of in the middle because i always think that helping people is a good thing and a way that you can get your blessings. But also sometime you have too help yourself be successful and make sure you can survive and provide. So to a certain extent it is good to help others but then its all about you.
arg33162_arg33074	a1	This is planet Earth, shared by billions, not just you. If given the opportunity to advance the human race, every person alive should take it; choosing personal gain over advancing the common good is selfish. There's no other way around it. I don't want ot hear "it's human nature to be selfish" or any other lame excuse. The point is we all live together, and if your too greedy and self-centered to care about your surroundings and the individuals around you, your merely taking up space.	Simply Written <br/> Seeking to advance the Common good <br/> allows doors to be opened and barriers to be <br/> broken, and after a journey (or) series of <br/> considerate acts one can have an less-difficult <br/> time Persuing a "Personal" goal or Lifestyle. <br/> The word for this debate is <br/> [sacrifice] <br/> How much would a person really "sacrifice" <br/> for his or her neighbor without being <br/> blinded by the light beemed from selfishness?? <br/> No matter where a person is in thier life.... <br/> Remember, you MAY NOT know what they did <br/> (or) WHAT they gave-up to be there!
arg33113_arg33060	a2	Benefiting yourself is always an assessable task but having a chance to better the common good only comes around once in a life time. You have to take into consideration that you can improve the lives or situations of the masses or just yourself. I believe that by advancing the common good you spread the wealth of nobility to others as well as yourself and that is the greatest benefit of all.	I think that advancing the common good is better than personal pursuit. The reason for this is that it is better to help others than just to think about yourself. We need to improve our community first before we think about ourselves. If everyone tried to take care of their community then there would be no dangerous places.
arg33176_arg33075	a2	Advancing the common good is much better. From the very first day our parents or our teachers have taught us about team work. <br/> The whole point of doing community service is about the common good. We have to help others in order to help our selves.	While striving to make advancements for the common good you can change the world forever. <br/> Allot of people have succeded in doing so. Our founding fathers, Thomas Edison, George Washington, Martin Luther King jr, and many more. These people made huge advances for the common good and they are honored for it.

I feel good when i help people because it makes me feel happy that im doing something good in life.

Advancing the common good is always better than personal pursuit. If every person decided to advance the common good, then every person would see the effects of it. Of course, most people chose personal pursuit because they will benefit from it.
arg33131_arg33178	a2	I think advancing the common good is better, because it will eventually come back to you anyways. If you better the world somehow, it will also help you out in some way. Whether it is money, fame or just karma.	Advancing the common good is better because like the bible says "Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor." For example, football is a team sport they all have to believe in each other and not in their selves because there is no "I in Team", like the other night in the Super Bowl the Steelers couldn't score the winning drive in the last 2 minutes with out the lineman blocking for the quarterback, quarterback believing in the lineman, and the receiver believing in the quarterback to make a good pass. So we need each other and depend on each other to be great.
arg33134_arg33103	a1	Usually my decision in the end is yes and no,or goes both ways. Today, however it is advancing for the common good. Making a decision to better suit yourself will help you for that moment, but in the long run who will it really help? Whereas, if you make an advancement for the common good you help yourself and other people. If you think about it we all want the world to be a "better place", and if you've noticed personal endeavors have gotten "us" into some not so happy predicaments.	I say the common good because of the type of forces that you can make as a whole group. like that person that says that by not voting they are not making a difference and when you look at the whole the population or percentage is bigger than of those who did vote. So if you want a good to be down and win you need more than yourself to win by looking for others with the same views.
arg33100_arg33147	a2	Well personally I think that personal pursuit is better. No reason really, I just feel that I can help the people I care about most if im looking out for myself instead of the whole world. If i focus on my goals then someday I may be able to give my family what they have always dreamed about in return helping me even more.	In my opinion, i think that advancing the common good is better because when helping others, not only is it appreciated by that person or people, but it makes you feel better as well. It doesn't mean that I won't spend time on myself, but if I have the opportunity to help others, I'll do my best to accomplish that.

I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.
arg33135_arg33099	a1	I think common good is better than personal pursuit because it's always better to assist other people. When people help each other out its more likely that everything comes out great. You get to become a role model by helping some one that needs your help. Yes personal pursuit is important when you are thinking of going to college. But than you got to think about leaving legacy behind by teaching other what you know. So the learning or society process can advance. So therefore you let others take it to the next level.	advancing the common good is better to me because, If i were to pursue my own personal pursuit, it wouldn't be all that good, because most of them would be selfish choices that woulld end up hurting someone else, i dont like hurting people. It would be a much better world if we thought about everyone else well being before we think about our selves.

I think advancing the common good would be better in the long run. I mean sure you can worry about yourself, but put it like this, "Your not the most important person in the world". If everyone just thought about just them and not about other people where would we be. Its better to put others first and think about yourself later then to put yourself first.
arg33156_arg33178	a2	Everybody has goals and things that they want to accomplish in life. However, a person that helps the community and puts other people in front of themselves will most surely live a better life.

arg33155_arg33177	a1	Advancing the Common good is a better endeavor than a personal pursuit. For example there are those who want to help others. A personal pursuit however is only for those selfish people who only care about themselves. The common good happens to some from a loan for college, to a charity for an orphanage, a school, etc	Well, I take the perspective of my parents, because of the way they try to make me, my brother, the rest of the family and friends happy. they would spend all of there money and time on others than themselves.
arg33114_arg33103	a2	i believe they are diffenrent ways of feeling happy and proud of what you do, i feel happy helping others that doesnt means i help every person in front of me, i try to do what i think is best and good to make somebody happy.

arg33141_arg33092	a2	I believe its best advancing towards the common good, but it doesn't really exist in this world. Mostly everyone is greedy, selfish, only would care about what they want, and not caring about what others would want. I believe everyone have small feeling towards the common good, but most people think they are important than anyone else in the whole world.

arg33089_arg33119	a2	The ability to do both would be awesome, but since I have to choose I'd rather help others in any way I can.

arg33114_arg33139	a2	i believe they are diffenrent ways of feeling happy and proud of what you do, i feel happy helping others that doesnt means i help every person in front of me, i try to do what i think is best and good to make somebody happy.	There once was a rapper who said he was the people's Champ. When wanting to be successful sometimes you need to worry about the common good because that's what people want. I believe that advancing the common good is a better endeavor. Because when always thinking about your self and your personal pursuits you tend to become conceited and become an A hole. And an A jerk is a person that's not liked and when alone and not liked by others becomes lonely.

And an A jerk is a person that's not liked and when alone and not liked by others becomes lonely.	Advancing the common good is much better. From the very first day our parents or our teachers have taught us about team work. <br/> The whole point of doing community service is about the common good. We have to help others in order to help our selves.
arg33084_arg33099	a1	Whether you are in a venture purely for yourself or others, you still end up affecting the people around you. <br/> When asking someone why they decide to help with the common good, the response would be something along the lines of, "it feels good to help out." <br/> Ultimately, people don't help out people unless they get some sort of satisfaction out of it, be it whether they community service hours, material rewards, fame, or just having the satisfaction of knowing that you have importance. So when helping out others, you make others feel good as well as yourself.	advancing the common good is better to me because, If i were to pursue my own personal pursuit, it wouldn't be all that good, because most of them would be selfish choices that woulld end up hurting someone else, i dont like hurting people. It would be a much better world if we thought about everyone else well being before we think about our selves.
arg33122_arg33061	a1	I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.	I think that advancing the common good is better because its helping out the community. But personal pursuit will be better because i know that if i dont go to college after high school then i wont go at all so i would choose my personal pursuit.
arg33089_arg33131	a1	The ability to do both would be awesome, but since I have to choose I'd rather help others in any way I can. Even a little thing can impact someone's life, like being a friend or helping them with getting their needs to survive life.	I think advancing the common good is better, because it will eventually come back to you anyways. If you better the world somehow, it will also help you out in some way. Whether it is money, fame or just karma.
arg33082_arg33141	a1	Both endeavors are better to be part of.But I as an individual I would like to advance the common good in this society to become unpetty with each other,to do things way better than they use to.Everyone in this world knows what they want to be. To be alone pursuing their dreams without the help of others, but some other will help the community to make it safe and better.To teach them what they are capable of,to beleive in themselfs that they can do as the things wealthy people does.	I believe its best advancing towards the common good, but it doesn't really exist in this world. Mostly everyone is greedy, selfish, only would care about what they want, and not caring about what others would want. I believe everyone have small feeling towards the common good, but most people think they are important than anyone else in the whole world.
arg33135_arg33061	a1	I think common good is better than personal pursuit because it's always better to assist other people. When people help each other out its more likely that everything comes out great. You get to become a role model by helping some one that needs your help. Yes personal pursuit is important when you are thinking of going to college. But than you got to think about leaving legacy behind by teaching other what you know. So the learning or society process can advance. So therefore you let others take it to the next level.	I think that advancing the common good is better because its helping out the community.

arg33110_arg33092	a2	I strongly believe that helping yourself is not a selfish thing to do. If everyone took care of themselves and tried to make themselves better people then there would be no use of common good. You are the only person that knows what you feel, think and believe if you want change you would do change to yourself.	I think the common good is a better endeavor, because it's better to give then to receive. It's better to give other people you're hand out in help then you holding your own hand.

Whether it is money, fame or just karma.
arg33113_arg33178	a1	Benefiting yourself is always an assessable task but having a chance to better the common good only comes around once in a life time. You have to take into consideration that you can improve the lives or situations of the masses or just yourself. I believe that by advancing the common good you spread the wealth of nobility to others as well as yourself and that is the greatest benefit of all.	Advancing the common good is better because like the bible says "Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor." For example, football is a team sport they all have to believe in each other and not in their selves because there is no "I in Team", like the other night in the Super Bowl the Steelers couldn't score the winning drive in the last 2 minutes with out the lineman blocking for the quarterback, quarterback believing in the lineman, and the receiver believing in the quarterback to make a good pass. So we need each other and depend on each other to be great.
arg33061_arg33155	a2	I think that advancing the common good is better because its helping out the community. But personal pursuit will be better because i know that if i dont go to college after high school then i wont go at all so i would choose my personal pursuit.	Advancing the Common good is a better endeavor than a personal pursuit. For example there are those who want to help others. A personal pursuit however is only for those selfish people who only care about themselves. The common good happens to some from a loan for college, to a charity for an orphanage, a school, etc
arg33075_arg33084	a2	While striving to make advancements for the common good you can change the world forever. <br/> Allot of people have succeded in doing so. Our founding fathers, Thomas Edison, George Washington, Martin Luther King jr, and many more. These people made huge advances for the common good and they are honored for it.	Whether you are in a venture purely for yourself or others, you still end up affecting the people around you. <br/> When asking someone why they decide to help with the common good, the response would be something along the lines of, "it feels good to help out." <br/> Ultimately, people don't help out people unless they get some sort of satisfaction out of it, be it whether they community service hours, material rewards, fame, or just having the satisfaction of knowing that you have importance.

arg33090_arg33047	a2	I think common good is better than personal pursuit because its better to help other people. I feel good when i help people because it makes me feel happy that im doing something good in life.	In a perfect world, everyone would not be selfish and would use their talents and abilities for the good of humanity, but we don't live in a perfect world nor will we ever. I think that everyone has a God-given talent that can be used to better the world. If everyone put a little effort into improving society, our life would run a lot smoother. You can also combine the two if advancing the common good doesnt sound appealing to you. Their are plenty of jobs that do just that.

arg33103_arg33136	a2	I say the common good because of the type of forces that you can make as a whole group. like that person that says that by not voting they are not making a difference and when you look at the whole the population or percentage is bigger than of those who did vote. So if you want a good to be down and win you need more than yourself to win by looking for others with the same views.	I think advancing the common good would be better in the long run.

Making a decision to better suit yourself will help you for that moment, but in the long run who will it really help? Whereas, if you make an advancement for the common good you help yourself and other people. If you think about it we all want the world to be a "better place", and if you've noticed personal endeavors have gotten "us" into some not so happy predicaments.	While striving to make advancements for the common good you can change the world forever. <br/> Allot of people have succeded in doing so. Our founding fathers, Thomas Edison, George Washington, Martin Luther King jr, and many more. These people made huge advances for the common good and they are honored for it.
arg33103_arg33100	a1	I say the common good because of the type of forces that you can make as a whole group. like that person that says that by not voting they are not making a difference and when you look at the whole the population or percentage is bigger than of those who did vote. So if you want a good to be down and win you need more than yourself to win by looking for others with the same views.	Well personally I think that personal pursuit is better. No reason really, I just feel that I can help the people I care about most if im looking out for myself instead of the whole world. If i focus on my goals then someday I may be able to give my family what they have always dreamed about in return helping me even more.
arg33141_arg33060	a2	I believe its best advancing towards the common good, but it doesn't really exist in this world. Mostly everyone is greedy, selfish, only would care about what they want, and not caring about what others would want. I believe everyone have small feeling towards the common good, but most people think they are important than anyone else in the whole world.	I think that advancing the common good is better than personal pursuit. The reason for this is that it is better to help others than just to think about yourself. We need to improve our community first before we think about ourselves. If everyone tried to take care of their community then there would be no dangerous places.
arg33147_arg33047	a2	In my opinion, i think that advancing the common good is better because when helping others, not only is it appreciated by that person or people, but it makes you feel better as well. It doesn't mean that I won't spend time on myself, but if I have the opportunity to help others, I'll do my best to accomplish that.	In a perfect world, everyone would not be selfish and would use their talents and abilities for the good of humanity, but we don't live in a perfect world nor will we ever. I think that everyone has a God-given talent that can be used to better the world. If everyone put a little effort into improving society, our life would run a lot smoother. You can also combine the two if advancing the common good doesnt sound appealing to you. Their are plenty of jobs that do just that.
arg33131_arg33155	a2	I think advancing the common good is better, because it will eventually come back to you anyways. If you better the world somehow, it will also help you out in some way. Whether it is money, fame or just karma.	Advancing the Common good is a better endeavor than a personal pursuit. For example there are those who want to help others. A personal pursuit however is only for those selfish people who only care about themselves. The common good happens to some from a loan for college, to a charity for an orphanage, a school, etc
arg33113_arg33061	a1	Benefiting yourself is always an assessable task but having a chance to better the common good only comes around once in a life time. You have to take into consideration that you can improve the lives or situations of the masses or just yourself. I believe that by advancing the common good you spread the wealth of nobility to others as well as yourself and that is the greatest benefit of all.	I think that advancing the common good is better because its helping out the community. But personal pursuit will be better because i know that if i dont go to college after high school then i wont go at all so i would choose my personal pursuit.
arg33099_arg33075	a2	advancing the common good is better to me because, If i were to pursue my own personal pursuit, it wouldn't be all that good, because most of them would be selfish choices that woulld end up hurting someone else, i dont like hurting people. It would be a much better world if we thought about everyone else well being before we think about our selves.

So if you want a good to be down and win you need more than yourself to win by looking for others with the same views.	I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.

arg33162_arg33131	a1	This is planet Earth, shared by billions, not just you. If given the opportunity to advance the human race, every person alive should take it; choosing personal gain over advancing the common good is selfish. There's no other way around it. I don't want ot hear "it's human nature to be selfish" or any other lame excuse. The point is we all live together, and if your too greedy and self-centered to care about your surroundings and the individuals around you, your merely taking up space.

The ability to do both would be awesome, but since I have to choose I'd rather help others in any way I can.

arg33122_arg33099	a1	I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run. I believe in the what goes around comes around thing so when you do something for other people before you try to please yourself, not only does it help them but something good will also come back to you helping you better yourself.	advancing the common good is better to me because, If i were to pursue my own personal pursuit, it wouldn't be all that good, because most of them would be selfish choices that woulld end up hurting someone else, i dont like hurting people. It would be a much better world if we thought about everyone else well being before we think about our selves.
arg33047_arg33178	a1	In a perfect world, everyone would not be selfish and would use their talents and abilities for the good of humanity, but we don't live in a perfect world nor will we ever. I think that everyone has a God-given talent that can be used to better the world. If everyone put a little effort into improving society, our life would run a lot smoother. You can also combine the two if advancing the common good doesnt sound appealing to you. Their are plenty of jobs that do just that.	Advancing the common good is better because like the bible says "Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor." For example, football is a team sport they all have to believe in each other and not in their selves because there is no "I in Team", like the other night in the Super Bowl the Steelers couldn't score the winning drive in the last 2 minutes with out the lineman blocking for the quarterback, quarterback believing in the lineman, and the receiver believing in the quarterback to make a good pass. So we need each other and depend on each other to be great.
arg33160_arg33074	a1	Well me personally I think advancement of the common good is better. I don't really know how to back this up, I just know its the way i feel about the topic. I guess because I'm not a selfish person at all when it comes to anything. I believe in sharing and helping others out. So if there's something i have to sacrifice personally for the advance of the common good, 9 times out of 10 I'm going to do it.	Simply Written <br/> Seeking to advance the Common good <br/> allows doors to be opened and barriers to be <br/> broken, and after a journey (or) series of <br/> considerate acts one can have an less-difficult <br/> time Persuing a "Personal" goal or Lifestyle. <br/> The word for this debate is <br/> [sacrifice] <br/> How much would a person really "sacrifice" <br/> for his or her neighbor without being <br/> blinded by the light beemed from selfishness?? <br/> No matter where a person is in thier life.... <br/> Remember, you MAY NOT know what they did <br/> (or) WHAT they gave-up to be there!
arg33049_arg33147	a1	Advancing the common good is always better than personal pursuit. If every person decided to advance the common good, then every person would see the effects of it. Of course, most people chose personal pursuit because they will benefit from it.	In my opinion, i think that advancing the common good is better because when helping others, not only is it appreciated by that person or people, but it makes you feel better as well. It doesn't mean that I won't spend time on myself, but if I have the opportunity to help others, I'll do my best to accomplish that.

arg33100_arg33177	a1	Well personally I think that personal pursuit is better. No reason really, I just feel that I can help the people I care about most if im looking out for myself instead of the whole world. If i focus on my goals then someday I may be able to give my family what they have always dreamed about in return helping me even more.	Well, I take the perspective of my parents, because of the way they try to make me, my brother, the rest of the family and friends happy. they would spend all of there money and time on others than themselves.
arg33134_arg33047	a1	Usually my decision in the end is yes and no,or goes both ways. Today, however it is advancing for the common good. Making a decision to better suit yourself will help you for that moment, but in the long run who will it really help? Whereas, if you make an advancement for the common good you help yourself and other people. If you think about it we all want the world to be a "better place", and if you've noticed personal endeavors have gotten "us" into some not so happy predicaments.

arg33141_arg33114	a2	I believe its best advancing towards the common good, but it doesn't really exist in this world. Mostly everyone is greedy, selfish, only would care about what they want, and not caring about what others would want. I believe everyone have small feeling towards the common good, but most people think they are important than anyone else in the whole world.	i believe they are diffenrent ways of feeling happy and proud of what you do, i feel happy helping others that doesnt means i help every person in front of me, i try to do what i think is best and good to make somebody happy.

I strongly believe that helping yourself is not a selfish thing to do. If everyone took care of themselves and tried to make themselves better people then there would be no use of common good. You are the only person that knows what you feel, think and believe if you want change you would do change to yourself.
arg33162_arg33060	a2	This is planet Earth, shared by billions, not just you. If given the opportunity to advance the human race, every person alive should take it; choosing personal gain over advancing the common good is selfish. There's no other way around it. I don't want ot hear "it's human nature to be selfish" or any other lame excuse. The point is we all live together, and if your too greedy and self-centered to care about your surroundings and the individuals around you, your merely taking up space.	I think that advancing the common good is better than personal pursuit. The reason for this is that it is better to help others than just to think about yourself. We need to improve our community first before we think about ourselves. If everyone tried to take care of their community then there would be no dangerous places.

arg33155_arg33129	a2	Advancing the Common good is a better endeavor than a personal pursuit. For example there are those who want to help others. A personal pursuit however is only for those selfish people who only care about themselves. The common good happens to some from a loan for college, to a charity for an orphanage, a school, etc	I volunteer at Irving Cares, and when I do I feel so great that I can help the community. To me when I help advance the common good I am helping myself. When people do something for the good of others it helps them out in the long run. Whether it is a favor in return or anything else. In a personal pursuit you are just helping yourself. If we all just helped ourselves where would our world be? We all depend on others for help at some point. This world should be about others, not just me.
arg33075_arg33089	a1	While striving to make advancements for the common good you can change the world forever. <br/> Allot of people have succeded in doing so. Our founding fathers, Thomas Edison, George Washington, Martin Luther King jr, and many more. These people made huge advances for the common good and they are honored for it.	The ability to do both would be awesome, but since I have to choose I'd rather help others in any way I can. Even a little thing can impact someone's life, like being a friend or helping them with getting their needs to survive life.

However, a person that helps the community and puts other people in front of themselves will most surely live a better life.

I believe that advancing the common good is a better endeavor. Because when always thinking about your self and your personal pursuits you tend to become conceited and become an A hole. And an A jerk is a person that's not liked and when alone and not liked by others becomes lonely.	I think common good is better than personal pursuit because its better to help other people.
