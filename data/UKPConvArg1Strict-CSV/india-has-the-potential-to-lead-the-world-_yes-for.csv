arg129377_arg110321	a2	India surely has the potential to lead the world.........Dr Manmohan Singh is considered as the most qualified prime minister all over the world.........India has proved its potential in various fields and aspects............	INDIA has the potential to lead the world. <br/> Full of natural resources, filled with highly spiritual people and country with diverse tounges and races. India has th potential to flourish. <br/> Well, I cannot ignore the fact that Indian government seems pretty corrupt and poverty still exists. <br/> But hey, China is communist, poverty is also seen in China.. <br/> So why not INDIA? <br/> INDIA DOES HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO LEAD THE WORLD
arg126374_arg119309	a1	India certainly has d potentials 2 lead d world...... <br/> in our real world power and weapons doesn't work any more <br/> maybe................................... <br/> maybe USA,UK or such other contries are more powerful but India is economically more strong.it is d hub 4 many other companies.	India is a good country to live in... <br/> it has diverse culture but still it unites as one. <br/> Saare jagah se achcha... <br/> Hindustan hamara...
arg121181_arg106101	a2	india can speak english better than orginal english man..britishers and americans speech includes a lot of grammatical mistakes ..so who is better....indians !!!! "truth is stranger than fiction".......	India is in my personal list of countries to keep an eye on over the next thirty years. I think they're a good contender for superpower status before the end of this century.
arg596217_arg131151	a1	yes,India has potential to lead the world.So, many countries depends on scientists.most of employees in every country is Indians.	To say India can not lead the world is to say that a newborn child can never walk!!! I agree that there r so many problems that the rising India is facing 2day bt we r getting better day by day!!!
arg596217_arg106426	a1	yes,India has potential to lead the world.So, many countries depends on scientists.most of employees in every country is Indians.	Do we have the potential? <br/> Yes. <br/> The only competition we have is China who has done a much better job for the long run. <br/> But then again the way India runs.. it always makes order out of chaos.
arg123811_arg130673	a2	ndians has always been powerful why r u forgeting about its ancient glory history	ooooooooh really David then why people from your country knock their doors in India for gaining peace and get rid of depression,why does most of the named firms of the world have highest no. of Indian employees cuz we are genius,and we are actually intellectually superior.in past we have lead the world and we'll surely lead the world again in near future wait and watch
arg276210_arg128880	a1	i just know that i am an Indian and i don't want to show my country down and the person who thinks that only by debate they will solve all the problems is wrong. <br/> because they also know that how is there country.

The other foreign countries are more developed den us bcoz it is da Indian people who are using their brain and making the foreign countries develop..........
arg106426_arg106165	a2	Do we have the potential? <br/> Yes. <br/> The only competition we have is China who has done a much better job for the long run. <br/> But then again the way India runs.. it always makes order out of chaos.	India and China could redefine what third world country means because in the future, both will be first and third world countries simultaneously.
arg119309_arg129910	a1	India is a good country to live in... <br/> it has diverse culture but still it unites as one. <br/> Saare jagah se achcha... <br/> Hindustan hamara...	we should not forget lord rama, krishna, vishvamitr etc which give far view that india will be the vishvguru in future
arg116888_arg106091	a2	Yes. India does have the potential to lead the world. If the Indian government can look after a country with 28 states of 28 ways, culture, geographical and language, it can certainly can lead the world. For example, there is heavy rainfall in Manipur , while there is water scarcity in Rajasthan. It also has the most wonderful technological developments. Economically also India isn't that low. Eg: Chandrayaan from India discovered water on Moon. What do u say about that? And the father of astronomy, aryabhatta was from India.	I believe that India is fast emerging as a hub for international trade and investment. India has provided a huge opportunity to enhance trade and investments in sectors such as mechanical and electrical engineering, food processing, automotive, tourism and banking among others. Almost every multinational company is focusing on India.

NAMASTE!!!!	India is a secular state.people of all communities reside here so india has the knowledge of almost all countries and the way they live. so it can easily lead all the people of world without creating any nuissance among anyone.
arg123809_arg116894	a2	i think there is no doubt on this that India has power to lead the world.	indian culture,,and languages are established 2000yrs ago where other countries are finding there languags
