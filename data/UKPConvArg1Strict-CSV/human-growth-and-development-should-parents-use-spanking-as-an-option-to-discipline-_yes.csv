arg334884_arg334932	a1	I believe so, it should be used as a last resort at least because I being a sibling of three, was spanked along with my sister and turned out to be disciplined and on the other hand our youngest sister has never been spanked and she tends to make more mistakes even now that shes 10 than we did.	Yes, because 1 getting hit helps you be stronger and grow up and 2 it makes you listen , it's not ABUSE it's getting spanked.
arg335124_arg334886	a2	Sometimes that's what a kid needs to behave all those Nos, stops, don't do that, just don't work sometimes.	Yes, because then they wont do what they did in fear of getting spanked again. Since they will know the consequence. Although, there is also a line a parent shouldn't cross such as the appropriate spanking and abuse line.
arg335285_arg334893	a2	spanking is your decision kids can be bad but use it as a last resort	Yes , because if they are afraid of getting spanked then they won't do it again . The parent should only spank them and not go over board and keep hitting them .
arg334967_arg335098	a2	I think spanking should be an option. Although I believe it should be an option, I believe it should be a last option.	I support this because... I got spanked and I turned out to be a good daughter ..spanking teaches you not to do it again and be scared of doing it again.
arg336199_arg335054	a2	I agree but it has to be used as the last source and not used constantly and of course not to hard.	I have been spanked once in a while for worse deeds. I think it did more good than harm to be honest. It's like touching fire to be honest, but a lot of it depends on parents and kids. It may do its job it may not, but abuse is never good.
arg335092_arg336043	a2	I think you should hit you kids because if they did something really bad like crash your car or steal you need to hit them so they know that they should not be doing that.	I think spanking should be used if it will teach thee child in the long run but each child responds differently to different punishments while one child just telling them no or grounding them will work on another child it may take a spanking to teach them right and wrong.

Yes so they can give the kids a reason not to do it again.
arg334921_arg335134	a1	After I was spanked, I never did the same thing twice.. So therefore I would spank my kids, out of love, and on the butt.	I believe spanking is a good option to punish a child if nothing else works
arg335089_arg334964	a2	yes because if they fear getting hit than they wont do it again	I agree because they must understand they where wrong. For their actions, they will receive consequences, and from that they will learn to not do it again.

arg334921_arg334922	a1	After I was spanked, I never did the same thing twice.. So therefore I would spank my kids, out of love, and on the butt.	I say yes because children are getting more and more violent and they need to get discipline if they decide to act up.
arg335034_arg336222	a2	Yes, because they need to learn in a way that they remember that if they do something bad. They will get hit.	Humans have been raised for thousands of years with not near as much resentment towards spanking and today's kids are the unruliest there are... <br/> There's a trend... <br/> (I do admit it's not purely spanking that's the cause but it's a small part of the bigger picture)
arg335047_arg334922	a1	Parents should use spanking as an option to discipline only when it's needed. If the child doesn't follow the correct behavior that they should follow after several times being warned, then that is when the child deserves a spanking.

arg334938_arg335285	a1	After a spanking I made sure I never did it again to avoid being punished because the second time is always worst because you were told not to already.	spanking is your decision kids can be bad but use it as a last resort
arg334973_arg336171	a2	Yes, parents should use spanking as an option to discipline their children, but it should be the last option.

Yes, because they need to learn in a way that they remember that if they do something bad. They will get hit.
arg334959_arg336171	a1	yea, because even though there are many other different ways to discipline kids, sometimes it won't work so they need a little spank, just to make them learn they were wrong. don't always be spanking them for no reason, that's bad	I believe that spanking you child because it shows then that what they did was wrong and if they dont want the feeling of a but woppen then they wont make the same mistake twice.
arg336176_arg334924	a2	Yes so they can give the kids a reason not to do it again.	because depending on the punishment you give a child it doesn't always work, some kids need need that. because just sitting them in punishment its a possibility they will do it again.

arg334924_arg334973	a2	because depending on the punishment you give a child it doesn't always work, some kids need need that. because just sitting them in punishment its a possibility they will do it again.	Yes, parents should use spanking as an option to discipline their children, but it should be the last option.
arg336199_arg334893	a2	I agree but it has to be used as the last source and not used constantly and of course not to hard.	Yes , because if they are afraid of getting spanked then they won't do it again . The parent should only spank them and not go over board and keep hitting them .
arg335124_arg335098	a2	Sometimes that's what a kid needs to behave all those Nos, stops, don't do that, just don't work sometimes.	I support this because... I got spanked and I turned out to be a good daughter ..spanking teaches you not to do it again and be scared of doing it again.
arg334964_arg334924	a1	I agree because they must understand they where wrong.

arg334898_arg335054	a2	I think parents should use spanking as an option to discipline but there is also a limit for everything so they shouldn't use it every time the kids do something wrong.	I have been spanked once in a while for worse deeds. I think it did more good than harm to be honest. It's like touching fire to be honest, but a lot of it depends on parents and kids. It may do its job it may not, but abuse is never good.
arg334973_arg336563	a2	Yes, parents should use spanking as an option to discipline their children, but it should be the last option.	Yes because that way the child can learn not to do it again because it really hurt, and i know this from experience.

I believe so, it should be used as a last resort at least because I being a sibling of three, was spanked along with my sister and turned out to be disciplined and on the other hand our youngest sister has never been spanked and she tends to make more mistakes even now that shes 10 than we did.
arg336563_arg334923	a2	Yes because that way the child can learn not to do it again because it really hurt, and i know this from experience.	I think that children should get spanked once in a while.

arg334922_arg334886	a2	I say yes because children are getting more and more violent and they need to get discipline if they decide to act up.

arg335034_arg335098	a2	Yes, because they need to learn in a way that they remember that if they do something bad. They will get hit.	I support this because... I got spanked and I turned out to be a good daughter ..spanking teaches you not to do it again and be scared of doing it again.
arg334898_arg336176	a1	I think parents should use spanking as an option to discipline but there is also a limit for everything so they shouldn't use it every time the kids do something wrong.	Yes so they can give the kids a reason not to do it again.
arg336176_arg334959	a2	Yes so they can give the kids a reason not to do it again.	yea, because even though there are many other different ways to discipline kids, sometimes it won't work so they need a little spank, just to make them learn they were wrong. don't always be spanking them for no reason, that's bad
arg335034_arg334893	a2	Yes, because they need to learn in a way that they remember that if they do something bad. They will get hit.	Yes , because if they are afraid of getting spanked then they won't do it again . The parent should only spank them and not go over board and keep hitting them .
arg334893_arg334924	a1	Yes , because if they are afraid of getting spanked then they won't do it again . The parent should only spank them and not go over board and keep hitting them .	because depending on the punishment you give a child it doesn't always work, some kids need need that. because just sitting them in punishment its a possibility they will do it again.
arg334972_arg334932	a1	I believe some parents should spank their kids but only when nessasary because sometimes thats the only way some kids will learn the correct way and listen.	Yes, because 1 getting hit helps you be stronger and grow up and 2 it makes you listen , it's not ABUSE it's getting spanked.
arg334920_arg335097	a2	It shouldn't be used constantly but it should be used to get the message across to the child	In my opinion, I strongly agree that parents should use spanking as an option to discipline their children because the spankings are painful enough for children to learn to avoid doing the wrong things.
arg336222_arg336176	a1	Humans have been raised for thousands of years with not near as much resentment towards spanking and today's kids are the unruliest there are... <br/> There's a trend... <br/> (I do admit it's not purely spanking that's the cause but it's a small part of the bigger picture)	Yes so they can give the kids a reason not to do it again.
arg335090_arg335092	a1	Yes I believe you should spank a child only when they know they are wrong. The child will understand more if he is scared to do the same mistake. Actions speak louder than words.	I think you should hit you kids because if they did something really bad like crash your car or steal you need to hit them so they know that they should not be doing that.
arg336176_arg336563	a2	Yes so they can give the kids a reason not to do it again.	Yes because that way the child can learn not to do it again because it really hurt, and i know this from experience.

arg336043_arg336199	a1	I think spanking should be used if it will teach thee child in the long run but each child responds differently to different punishments while one child just telling them no or grounding them will work on another child it may take a spanking to teach them right and wrong.	I agree but it has to be used as the last source and not used constantly and of course not to hard.
arg334973_arg335054	a2	Yes, parents should use spanking as an option to discipline their children, but it should be the last option.	I have been spanked once in a while for worse deeds. I think it did more good than harm to be honest. It's like touching fire to be honest, but a lot of it depends on parents and kids. It may do its job it may not, but abuse is never good.

arg336171_arg335285	a1	I believe that spanking you child because it shows then that what they did was wrong and if they dont want the feeling of a but woppen then they wont make the same mistake twice.	spanking is your decision kids can be bad but use it as a last resort
arg335047_arg334938	a2	Parents should use spanking as an option to discipline only when it's needed. If the child doesn't follow the correct behavior that they should follow after several times being warned, then that is when the child deserves a spanking.	After a spanking I made sure I never did it again to avoid being punished because the second time is always worst because you were told not to already.

I think you should hit you kids because if they did something really bad like crash your car or steal you need to hit them so they know that they should not be doing that.
arg336171_arg334922	a1	I believe that spanking you child because it shows then that what they did was wrong and if they dont want the feeling of a but woppen then they wont make the same mistake twice.	I say yes because children are getting more and more violent and they need to get discipline if they decide to act up.

arg335092_arg335285	a1	I think you should hit you kids because if they did something really bad like crash your car or steal you need to hit them so they know that they should not be doing that.	spanking is your decision kids can be bad but use it as a last resort
arg334973_arg334893	a2	Yes, parents should use spanking as an option to discipline their children, but it should be the last option.	Yes , because if they are afraid of getting spanked then they won't do it again . The parent should only spank them and not go over board and keep hitting them .
arg334964_arg336222	a2	I agree because they must understand they where wrong. For their actions, they will receive consequences, and from that they will learn to not do it again.	Humans have been raised for thousands of years with not near as much resentment towards spanking and today's kids are the unruliest there are... <br/> There's a trend... <br/> (I do admit it's not purely spanking that's the cause but it's a small part of the bigger picture)
arg334922_arg336176	a1	I say yes because children are getting more and more violent and they need to get discipline if they decide to act up.	Yes so they can give the kids a reason not to do it again.
arg335094_arg336199	a1	It's ok for the parent to spank the child as long as it's not often or they don't use other things like a belt.	I agree but it has to be used as the last source and not used constantly and of course not to hard.
arg335034_arg334919	a2	Yes, because they need to learn in a way that they remember that if they do something bad. They will get hit.	spanking can be sometimes good for the child to understand but not to the point where you can hurt and should not be used repeatedly
arg334924_arg334938	a2	because depending on the punishment you give a child it doesn't always work, some kids need need that. because just sitting them in punishment its a possibility they will do it again.	After a spanking I made sure I never did it again to avoid being punished because the second time is always worst because you were told not to already.
arg335094_arg334886	a2	It's ok for the parent to spank the child as long as it's not often or they don't use other things like a belt.	Yes, because then they wont do what they did in fear of getting spanked again. Since they will know the consequence. Although, there is also a line a parent shouldn't cross such as the appropriate spanking and abuse line.
arg334923_arg335034	a1	I think that children should get spanked once in a while. I got spanked when I was little but I could definitely say that I did learn lessons. Don't spank your kids though with whatever you find, you don't want to kill them !!	Yes, because they need to learn in a way that they remember that if they do something bad. They will get hit.
arg335047_arg335124	a1	Parents should use spanking as an option to discipline only when it's needed. If the child doesn't follow the correct behavior that they should follow after several times being warned, then that is when the child deserves a spanking.	Sometimes that's what a kid needs to behave all those Nos, stops, don't do that, just don't work sometimes.
arg336222_arg334898	a1	Humans have been raised for thousands of years with not near as much resentment towards spanking and today's kids are the unruliest there are... <br/> There's a trend... <br/> (I do admit it's not purely spanking that's the cause but it's a small part of the bigger picture)	I think parents should use spanking as an option to discipline but there is also a limit for everything so they shouldn't use it every time the kids do something wrong.

I have been spanked once in a while for worse deeds. I think it did more good than harm to be honest. It's like touching fire to be honest, but a lot of it depends on parents and kids.

I believe so, it should be used as a last resort at least because I being a sibling of three, was spanked along with my sister and turned out to be disciplined and on the other hand our youngest sister has never been spanked and she tends to make more mistakes even now that shes 10 than we did.
