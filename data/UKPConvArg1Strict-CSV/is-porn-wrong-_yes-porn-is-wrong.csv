Porn is wrong because you are being lustful: it's even more wrong when you're married because you're looking at another person in a preverted way that's not your wife or husband, which believe it or not, counts as cheating on them. But all of us have been lustful before, right? I'm not judging you, but it is wrong and you should stop.

This is against women empowerment in a sense that women are viewed merely as sex toys. Which at the end of the day affects how men perceive women which will in turn lead to a lot of disrespect and false perception. <br/> Now, how about crime rates? Murders, Rape, and Sexual Abuse.

If one is in a relationship then yes porn is wrong. No one has the right to tell others what to do, we can only hope to influence. Porn is disgusting. Seriously. It exploits men and women. It is not realistic and can split up relationships. <br/> If a man and a woman or a woman and a woman or man and a man are in a relationship then they should not need any other forms of sexual gratification other than their spouse. Out of love. And respect.

29393_1191878965	a1	Porn is wrong when it is not done in moderation. Porn addicts turn out to have intimacy issues in their relationships and mistreat and view women in a negative manner. Also people who are addicted to porn, expect all women to look like porn stars and act like porn stars, when in reality that is not what sex is about... But it tends to screw up their reality.	hells yeah porn is wrong. i mean wtf. film naked girls to publicly distribute it on the internet so jerk off's can jack off to them. porn is only here because it makes so much money and stupid people are buying into it. if it's not wrong then try watching it in front of your family, friends or the younger youth. yeah you would feel uncomfortable and you know why? because of common f**king sense and our conscience deep inside we know it's wrong.

But all of us have been lustful before, right? I'm not judging you, but it is wrong and you should stop.	depending on your beleifs <br/> because im christian i beleave it is <br/> but to someone eles whos not christian it may be completly ok

Porn is wrong because you are being lustful: it's even more wrong when you're married because you're looking at another person in a preverted way that's not your wife or husband, which believe it or not, counts as cheating on them. But all of us have been lustful before, right? I'm not judging you, but it is wrong and you should stop.
39342_54187	a2	The argument that porn would expose one to the reality in life, and thus increasing one's maturity and prevent possible future sexual assaults, is totally crap. <br/> porn is definitely wrong. after a dosage, the guilt of wasting ur time, wasting energy, wasting effort and not devoting urself to another thing and regretting that you should not have started would almost kill you. trust me. <br/> its a road that shld not be taken, its as bad as smoking and dugs. i think the only reason its not banned in most developed countries is that they are facing an aging population.	If one is in a relationship then yes porn is wrong. No one has the right to tell others what to do, we can only hope to influence. Porn is disgusting. Seriously. It exploits men and women. It is not realistic and can split up relationships. <br/> If a man and a woman or a woman and a woman or man and a man are in a relationship then they should not need any other forms of sexual gratification other than their spouse. Out of love. And respect.

39342_71555	a1	The argument that porn would expose one to the reality in life, and thus increasing one's maturity and prevent possible future sexual assaults, is totally crap. <br/> porn is definitely wrong. after a dosage, the guilt of wasting ur time, wasting energy, wasting effort and not devoting urself to another thing and regretting that you should not have started would almost kill you. trust me. <br/> its a road that shld not be taken, its as bad as smoking and dugs. i think the only reason its not banned in most developed countries is that they are facing an aging population.	Biblically, yes it is wrong. But aside from that, it can become an addiction that destroys lives just like drugs and alcohol. There is a reason why God tells us what to and what not to do.

Porn is wrong because you are being lustful: it's even more wrong when you're married because you're looking at another person in a preverted way that's not your wife or husband, which believe it or not, counts as cheating on them. But all of us have been lustful before, right? I'm not judging you, but it is wrong and you should stop.

54187_2137504198	a2	If one is in a relationship then yes porn is wrong. No one has the right to tell others what to do, we can only hope to influence. Porn is disgusting. Seriously. It exploits men and women. It is not realistic and can split up relationships. <br/> If a man and a woman or a woman and a woman or man and a man are in a relationship then they should not need any other forms of sexual gratification other than their spouse. Out of love. And respect.	This not only degrades morality, it also affects how women are treated in society today. This is against women empowerment in a sense that women are viewed merely as sex toys. Which at the end of the day affects how men perceive women which will in turn lead to a lot of disrespect and false perception. <br/> Now, how about crime rates? Murders, Rape, and Sexual Abuse. According to studies, all these people who committed these grave crimes all had one thing in common: PORN.

Porn is wrong when it is not done in moderation. Porn addicts turn out to have intimacy issues in their relationships and mistreat and view women in a negative manner. Also people who are addicted to porn, expect all women to look like porn stars and act like porn stars, when in reality that is not what sex is about... But it tends to screw up their reality.
29278_2137504198	a1	Porn is definitely wrong. Porn is like an addiction to some people which is unhealthy and can lead to guilt and lust. An addiction to porn gives an unhealthy image of real sex. Porn promotes the fact that sex is totally based on pleasure, but it is actually based on love and affection also. Porn inspired numerous crimes that sometimes abuse the rights and virginity of many people.	This not only degrades morality, it also affects how women are treated in society today. This is against women empowerment in a sense that women are viewed merely as sex toys. Which at the end of the day affects how men perceive women which will in turn lead to a lot of disrespect and false perception. <br/> Now, how about crime rates? Murders, Rape, and Sexual Abuse.
