HAHAHA	Christianity conflicts with historical, archaeological, astronomical, biological, and many other forms of evidence. It denies rational & impartial common sense. Its teachings, written by an all powerful, all knowing, creator of the universe, are filled with contradictions. The arguments for Christianity just don't hold ground (bar one or two, and those are close). Atheism is not perfect, but it is the more logical position of the two.
arg439197_arg240625	a1	I'm sad to see the way this turned out. With not so little respect and so much spamming.

Neither. Agnostic is the true answer. People can believe there is a God or they can believe there isn't- but they can never know.

Firstly because it is not one belief that every Christian shares, it lacks solidarity. I compare it to a road with all different kinds of sideways.

Most of the followers at least. Then there are theists who will twist ANY logic to fit their views. They're intelligent ones that you have to watch out for ;) <br/> I'm not an atheist by any means, but I'd rather call myself an atheist than a Christian. <br/> It allows for more logic in my mind.	ever since recorded history weve believed in sky spirits for which no evidence exists at all.

arg231497_arg240623	a1	INTELLIGENT DESIGN THEORY IS MERELY CHRISTIANITY MASQUERADING AS SCIENCE, BUT THERE IS NO REAL SCIENCE BEHIND INTELLIGENT DESIGN.	there is no god. Science has proven it. It was just an excuse made up so people from simplier times didnt have to think to hard on those big questions.
