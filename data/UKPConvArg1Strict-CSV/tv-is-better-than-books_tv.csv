arg479199_arg585676	a1	TV is better than books because the educational programs on TV are much more convenient and easy to understand. It is also easy to use for people who cannot see or hear. Books are also likely to be not updated with latest information about a certain topic while information from TV can be much more accurate and useful.	Television uses electricity and books such as harry potter are made of trees so it causes more damage to the environment.
arg640285_arg585674	a2	i believe books are better(i believe i can fly...) <br/> So true	A picture is worth a thousand words. TV lets you see and hear a story, or information. Imagine just reading about the recent disasters in Japan, Alabama and Missouri vs. seeing them and seeing interviews with survivors. Much more powerful and immediate on TV. <br/> Books take too much time. TV gives the info much faster.
arg561428_arg135689	a1	TV ,,!! because you can get information from different resources in a short time ,,, but Books you must read a lot to get that much of information !!	you can just sit on the couch with some crisps or a burger or sweets and watch tv when you cant be botherd to to anything else

arg420287_arg470033	a2	I like tv because you can watch all the porn you want with your family	I think T.V. is more helpful as the you can watch and listen to something being explained like if we read about budding or spore formation we have to create an image about that in mind, but when we watch the animation of budding then we could understand better. Some people can't even imagine so T.V. is helpful. As concerning the time limit or harm to our eyes, we should watch T.V. in a limit, because the excess of everything is harmful, even reading of books. <br/> Surveys have found that a normal person can remember 10% of what he had read and 50% of what he had listened and watched.
arg585686_arg637551	a2	TV is important for communication. This is to cross the charector limit.	TV can be better than books because TV can show the characters' faces and the action can be displayed that is hard for one to decipher from a book.

arg618914_arg246025	a1	Unless the brain is used no human being can understand any medium. Be it TV or books. By watching the television people can create a make believe situation and think. "What if they would go left? They would be SAVED, wouldn't they?" Even viewing tv requires brains. And moreover we can watch television in the dark. But to read a book you need the lights on. Which also wastes electricity.	tv because only tv can bring u live news at books u can't find also it's educational

arg363603_arg585676	a1	I think TV is better if you are watching an informational channel and it is better than books because you can switch to different informational channels an search documentaries on different subjects and when you are done learning and ready to relax you can switch to a funny show or what ever you want to watch.	Television uses electricity and books such as harry potter are made of trees so it causes more damage to the environment.
arg585674_arg399270	a1	A picture is worth a thousand words. TV lets you see and hear a story, or information. Imagine just reading about the recent disasters in Japan, Alabama and Missouri vs. seeing them and seeing interviews with survivors. Much more powerful and immediate on TV. <br/> Books take too much time. TV gives the info much faster.	Without TV actors/actresses wouldn't have jobs. <br/> Without TV you wouldn't know what's happening around the world.

arg479199_arg363603	a1	TV is better than books because the educational programs on TV are much more convenient and easy to understand. It is also easy to use for people who cannot see or hear.

Which also wastes electricity.	TV is WAY better than reading books from the blimem OLDEN DAYS!!!
