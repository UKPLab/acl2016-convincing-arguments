arg167722_arg168768	a2	Farquhar did all the ground work to improve Singapore but Raffles only dreamt about what to do.	It is clear that Stamford Raffles was the basis for the idea but the implementation was left to Farquhar so i believe he is the rightful founder of Singapore. Raffles was just the 'idea man' before the founding but was summoned to Bencoolen by his superiors and did not have much contribution to the founding of Singapore.

Faruhar carried out the 'grand plan' of Raffles'. Raffles practically just sat there and watched it all go, not even lifting a finger to help.

Plus, to drive my point further, the countries that were run by Raffles all ended up BADLY. This shows that Raffles was a bad developer of the country.	When Farquhar left Singapore, more people were there to send him off than Raffles. This shows that the people recognized Farquhar as their founder, not Raffles
arg168776_arg168820	a1	Farquar protected Singapore from Dutch attacks and attracted traders to Singapore while Raffles was away.	William made the initiative to understand the locals and to communicate with them. He even learnt Malay just so to make conversation easier.
arg168777_arg168806	a1	He invited the immigrants from Malacca to come and trade and stationed an office at St. John's Island to inform the trading ships passing by about the settlement in Singapore.	There were a lot of pests at that time, and the people were suffering from them. Raffles wasn't around, and William had to think of a solution himself.
arg168834_arg168811	a1	Raffles doesn't care about the citizens, doesn't spare a thought at all. <br/> So what if he discovered the island majulah singapura, he did not help in the least in singapore's development. so why in the world should he deserve the title of 'singapore's founder'? <br/> Farquhar developed the island, with all his ideas contributing to the development.	William Farquhar was removed from his position by Raffles because Farquhar had grown too close to the people. However, knowing the people well is necessary to help Farquhar solve the problems faced by the people.
arg168767_arg168780	a2	Farquhar was the one to take charge of the new settlement and keep it running against all odds after British presence was introduced, as Raffles had to return to Bencoolen.	Faruhar carried out the 'grand plan' of Raffles'. Raffles practically just sat there and watched it all go, not even lifting a finger to help. It doesn't matter if Raffles was the head of the so-called operation, Farquhar was the one to DEVELOP Singapore to what it is today.
arg168779_arg168825	a2	Farquhar was unjustly exiled by Raffles even though William had done a lot to help Singapore.	When Farquhar left Singapore, more people were there to send him off than Raffles. This shows that the people recognized Farquhar as their founder, not Raffles
arg168777_arg168830	a1	He invited the immigrants from Malacca to come and trade and stationed an office at St. John's Island to inform the trading ships passing by about the settlement in Singapore.	Raffles came and left Singapore, returning after a long period of time. Farquar stayed here all the time, and solved many problems. Raffles did not do much at all compared to Farquar.
arg168791_arg168764	a1	There were pests like centipedes and rats all over the island. These pests hurt some people. The rats also destroyed the food supplies. Tigers were also a threat to the people here. He solved it by giving rewards were given to those people who killed these pests.	Farquhar was the one that played the role of a 'mother' to Singapore.He contributed more to Singapore than Raffles supporting the fact that he was the founder of Singapore.
arg168770_arg168825	a2	Raffles unjustly removed Farquhar from his position in Singapore and accused him of ' being too close to the local population '. I think that it is unfair that a person who contributed so much to Singapore's development be unjustly sent off like that.	When Farquhar left Singapore, more people were there to send him off than Raffles. This shows that the people recognized Farquhar as their founder, not Raffles
arg168801_arg168818	a2	Farquhar contributed significantly, even forking out his own money to start up the colony carved out of the jungle, by first offering money as an incentive for people to hunt and to exterminate rats and centipedes. Raffles did nothing of that sort.	To me, a founder would be a leader, well respected by the organisation/group he is managing. Both Raffles and Farquhar were good leaders. However, when William Farquhar was sent off to Britain, more people went to send him off than the combined number of people that sent Raffles off during the three times Raffles left Singapore. This shows that the people of Singapore respected Farquhar more than Raffles, and to them, Farquhar was a more competent leader.
arg168812_arg168801	a2	Without William Farquhar Singapore would have perished. Only because William was there to govern the country, Singapore continued to exist. Raffles left to govern another country.	Farquhar contributed significantly, even forking out his own money to start up the colony carved out of the jungle, by first offering money as an incentive for people to hunt and to exterminate rats and centipedes. Raffles did nothing of that sort.
arg168786_arg168777	a2	When Farquar was fired by Raffles, he was given a grander ceremony before he left compared to Raffles, which show how much the people loved him.	He invited the immigrants from Malacca to come and trade and stationed an office at St. John's Island to inform the trading ships passing by about the settlement in Singapore.

I think that it is unfair that a person who contributed so much to Singapore's development be unjustly sent off like that.	Raffles neglected Singapore when he went around conquering other 'more useful' countries for about FOUR years, leaving all the work to Farquhar to settle. Plus, to drive my point further, the countries that were run by Raffles all ended up BADLY. This shows that Raffles was a bad developer of the country.

Raffles did nothing of that sort.	William Farquhar was sacked. Despite his many positive achievements in the formative period of Singapore's development, he adopted measures in his administration which conflicted with Raffles' instructions, so a lot of people would just ignore Farquhar's contribution and credit them to Raffles
arg168793_arg168808	a1	Even though William had legalized gambling, he did it so that Singapore can prosper, but Raffles had turned it down, leaving Singapore alone.	Crimes like robbing and fighting often occurred. Farquhar set up a small police force.
arg168773_arg168766	a1	William Farquhar stayed in Singapore longer than Raffles, so Farquhar had more time to get to know the people more, to earn the trust of the people, to find out the problems that the people were facing and to solve those problems	William Farquhar was sacked.
