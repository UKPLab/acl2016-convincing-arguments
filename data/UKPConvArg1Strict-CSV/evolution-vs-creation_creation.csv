I am a nurse and the more I studied biology, the more I was in awe of the miracle of our bodies. Every tiny cell has it's own design that is even more complex than a computer. When you look at a computer do you question that there had to be a creator? Or do you need proof that this highly organized machine came to be about by a mere accident or order of circumstances? Evolutionists need more faith than Creationists.

The scientific rigor you mention is not present in evolutionary theory. Here's one example: In the 1800s, Charles Lyell and others came up with dates for the rock strata. Radiometric dating wasn't invented until the 1900s. When it was invented, the techniques were calibrated to match the dates Lyell came up with. To say that this proves the dates that Lyell came up with is a logical fallacy, and it sure doesn't sound like true scientific rigor to me.

We can't say that creation is false, because there is no explanation provided for the origins of the "particles" that caused the evolution theory.

Since creation cannot be ruled out in any way, and evolution can, creation is the best possible theory.

28068_12575	a1	"Debates are based on convincing evidence. There is very little evidence supporting creation, while there are massive amounts supporting an evolutionary argument." <br/> True. But, evidence must withstand the test of accepted truth. We can't say that creation is false, because there is no explanation provided for the origins of the "particles" that caused the evolution theory. Although the evolution theory is interesting, and quite possible, it does not rule out creation. Since creation cannot be ruled out in any way, and evolution can, creation is the best possible theory.

We can't say that creation is false, because there is no explanation provided for the origins of the "particles" that caused the evolution theory. Although the evolution theory is interesting, and quite possible, it does not rule out creation.

Ah yes, the classic peppered moth argument <br/> I'm very familiar with it <br/> I'm not sure how that proves the evolutionary process <br/> Both moth colors have always been there <br/> Its just a matter of which is it easier for their prey to see. That's not evolution- <br/> That's a diet plan
67586_12586	a1	although i voted for evolution... creation is easier to accept due to the fact that someone somewhere had to change aspects of the universe in order for us to exist.	Then according to your theory the fruit flies would have adapted and survived <br/> So I'm not really sure how that argument works...
70855_12580	a2	There has to have been a creator. If you believe in 'The Big Bang', then that's fine. But what caused it? And if it was caused by certain gases reacting with each other, then where did those gases come from? It doesn't matter how you think this universe came to be. The point is that it can't have just appeared. There must have been a creator.	That's your best argument - "Because they don't" ? <br/> I thought there was a reason for everything... <br/> I don't see the squirrel outside my window evolving. In fact, I'm pretty sure squirrels have looked and acted the same for thousands of years. <br/> How does an animal aquire a trait that he wasn't born with? Does he just wish for it really hard and it magically grows? <br/> And you proved my point - "species have certain characteristics and properties" <br/> I noticed you didn't mention that their characteristics randomly change <br/> And by the way, I'm just wondering because I'm a curious person... <br/> what insects are you talking about?
12583_68913	a2	You're just as much brainwashed as I am <br/> except you're the other side	In the 21'st century, we have come to a point where the only way for us to evolve is to start to create. Creation is evolution just with more responsibility placed on mankind.
12581_68938	a2	Just because you think your opponent has been brainwashed one way or the other does not make your argument any stronger	Could a unproven higher power have created a perfect world that appeared to have existed for more than 10 million years when really it is only 1 hundred thousand years old?
12581_12592	a2	Just because you think your opponent has been brainwashed one way or the other does not make your argument any stronger	I can prove to you that humans have not evolved since the beginning of recorded history
12595_12585	a1	Believing "Evolution" as in Darwinism and the like, is like believing the puzzle can be solved by pouring the pieces out because two pieces kind of stuck together.	Ah yes, the classic peppered moth argument <br/> I'm very familiar with it <br/> I'm not sure how that proves the evolutionary process <br/> Both moth colors have always been there <br/> Its just a matter of which is it easier for their prey to see.

844698385_68938	a2	Evolution is as likely as a tornado going through a junkyard and putting together a 747 Airplane.	Could a unproven higher power have created a perfect world that appeared to have existed for more than 10 million years when really it is only 1 hundred thousand years old?
12589_12588	a1	That doesn't make much sense. Why are we still evolving and the monkeys aren't? <br/> Why aren't fish jumping out of the water and growing legs? <br/> I mean, if it happened billions of years ago than how come its not happening today? <br/> Why can't we find psuedo-hybrid fish with legs forming? <br/> What caused evolution to stop happening for a mysterious time of thousands of years?	That's interesting because the burden of proof rests on you to prove that we are still evolving. <br/> I don't know about anyone else but I haven't noticed mankind change form for a few thousand years.... <br/> Another question- With this whole "big bang" theory. It seems like everything should have blown apart in a big bang and not come together.
844698385_80918	a1	Evolution is as likely as a tornado going through a junkyard and putting together a 747 Airplane.	you cannot argue with the theory of creatoinism without getting into an extreamly dumb argument because anybody who beleives in creatoinism who is arguing with anyone who doesn't can say that god makes them think what they think <br/> TAKE A HINT EVERYBODY THIS ARGUMENT IS MORONIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

44218_12563	a1	it shouldnt be about how we got here but why are we here.	Oops, I meant to say creationist version of evolution. My apologies.

That's not evolution- <br/> That's a diet plan	now tell me this evolution beleivers... how is it that evolution is true, and man kind is currently not evolving? and how is it (for those of you whom HAVE religion), that adam and eve were the first of the human race to walk on this very planet, the 'parents' of mankind? in arabic makind is 'bani adam' which literally means the tribe of adam...
