arg161579_arg135650	a2	Books r like cool! TV is not! Books are for nerds, Tv is for weirdos, I think Black ops is better! ROFL!	If those who have actually read a book, then there is really no debate.
arg213472_arg315568	a1	books is well better than tv because it is cheaper to buy a book <br/> if you wanted to buy a tv it would be really dear and you have to buy a tv licence <br/> books can help you learn <br/> a lot of the stuff on tv is either violent or not right for kids <br/> so books are well better	While there are benifits to TV, i think books are better overal for learning as they require more focus.
arg135922_arg345719	a1	some ppl cant read is absolutely idiotic to say <br/> the ppl who cant read wud always run away frm dem <br/> bt even den B for books nd B for best <br/> so books r da best <br/> i cant sleep if i wont read a chapter frm any novel each day <br/> bt actually sometimes i feel reading books all day becomes boring (in schools textbooks nd at home novels) so only sometimes i watch tv nd dat 2 news channels <br/> hence by reading books i can even pass my time nd even improve my speaking skills	Have any of you noticed that those who are against books are the ones who have terrible arguments. Like that person who just said TV is awesome with many exclamation marks and in capitals. That clearly proves that books are much better than TV because it TV rots the brain.
