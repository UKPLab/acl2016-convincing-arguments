India... where they have like a whole class of opressed people and a huge wealth differences? And with a language that the majority of the world can't understand and doesn't want to understand? India's education quality has nothing compared to Western education and it's the superpowers that control the world's economy. <br/> I highly doubt India will ever lead the world, and it doesn't even have the potential to. It should leave that to the superpowers.

arg109565_arg123178	a1	India will not lead the world because the gap between the rich and poor is too great and they still heavily believe in the caste system.	i think with this growing condition Idia cannot replace other developed countries like USA LONDON AND other countries. <br/> Because most of the people are illitrate here so i think india cant.

arg145468_arg122478	a1	All we can say is a big IF because we are not yet 100% sure if this nation itself could lead the whole world. Who knows maybe in the future that India could fail to lead us. There are still other countries who are more progressive, more literated, more powerful than India, like the USA, United Kingdom, Russia, Japan, etc. This nation doesn't have yet enought potentials and ability to sustain the needs of the people. India is not yet that full of technologies like in the Americas. Well in fact technology is one of the most sophisticated and essential inventions ever created.	i think, the india is not ready to lead the world because of many reasons.. <br/> 1.) the politians of our country are involved in black money cases. they try to gain or earn money as possible. <br/> 2.) they always try to make a big issue of useless topics. e.g., if a politian says something about another politian, they try to make it a big issue .
