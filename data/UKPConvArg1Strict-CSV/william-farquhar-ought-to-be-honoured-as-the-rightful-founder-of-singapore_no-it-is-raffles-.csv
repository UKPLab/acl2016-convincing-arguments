arg580842_arg168824	a2	Raffles had a vision for Singapore that it will be an orderly, elegant, rational and modern and he worked towards it. And while Raffles was gone, Farquhar developed Singapore poorly causing Raffles to feel dissappointed.	Raffles was the person who signed a treaty with the Temenggong and also the Sultan Hussien, and not William Farquhar. I agree that William Farquhar was the one that remained in Singapore to keep it running and also developed it further, but Raffles was the one who gave him the position because he had to leave and return to Bencoolen, also, he was the one who laid out the foundation of Singapore's Development, so he should be considered a founder.
arg168836_arg168794	a2	Farquhar has a boss!(raffles) he has to follow raffles and not go about doing anything else if then why cant farquhar help singapore after he was fired? I say again you do need to be in a certain position to be a founder as time, money, effort is all invested. You must know people who would help you.	It was Raffles who signed the treaty with the Sultan Hussein,not Farquhar. Farquhar was just Raffles subordinate.
arg168778_arg168790	a1	FOUNDER IS NOT A PERSON WHO "DISCOVERS" A PLACE if so i can say the prince Sanila Utama is the founder of singapore!(this for some who say farquhar saw the island first) And I do know that farquer has been very involved in this help and sometimes even does all the work but let me remind you that being raffles "assistant" he still had to consult raffles and raffles had all authority over Singapore therefore he was given credit. Then i would like to ask u a question why then does the names "raffles institution" "raffles hospital" raffles medical clinics"	He revived the cultural heritage of the region by setting up schools for the Chinese and Malays and did a lot for the people while Farquhar just wanted to gain control through his actions.
arg168815_arg168821	a1	To be able to have a succeful trading port you must have good contacts with many people and raffles had those contacts without him we would not have a trading port at all! I would like to mention that raffles had all the important qualities of a founder and he was in good position to do so. He invested a lot and we therefore credit him as our founder! We say Obama is the "founder" of health reform WHY because he was in such a high position and he could do something like invest money time and effort in such a project.	Even though Raffles sacked Farquhar when he came back to Singapore, this was because Farquhar was adopting measures that were not approved by Raffles. I believe Farquhar was adopting measures that were indirectly harmful to the population and Raffles sacked him for the best interests of Singapore's population at heart
arg168785_arg168800	a1	Raffles was responsible for Singapore's boost of economy <br/> He increased the economy of Singapore by using the Straits of Malacca as a trading route. <br/> He established free trade and thus many people came to Singapore to trade with each other, boosting Singapore's economy. <br/> Raffles was responsible for Singapore's boost of economy	Some would say that raffles left singapore for a few years and left farquer incharge therefore he negleted us. Imagine SST Ngee Ann Poly and NTU have done so much for us and are considered the founders of us are you trying to imply that because now they are back taking care OF THEIR OWN SCHOOLS. Another good example would be if Lee Hsien Lioeng took a day off for family time would you say he is not our prime minister anymore? Would you say he is neglecting singapore? He has a life!
arg168798_arg168816	a1	Sir Raffles is the rightful founder because ,he increased the economy of Singapore by using the Straits of Malacca as a trading route. He established free trade and thus many people came to Singapore to trade with each other, boosting Singapore's economy.	On 28 January 1819,Raffles came to Singapore. When Raffles saw the good location of Singapore and he signed a agreement with the Sultan of Johor on behalf of the British East India Company on February 1819 to use the southern part of Singapore as a British trading post and settlement.

arg168775_arg168836	a1	It was Raffles that led the expedition in order to find a new trading port. Farquhar only tagged along with Raffles. So even if Farquhar did not come Raffles would have still founded Singapore.	Farquhar has a boss!(raffles) he has to follow raffles and not go about doing anything else if then why cant farquhar help singapore after he was fired? I say again you do need to be in a certain position to be a founder as time, money, effort is all invested. You must know people who would help you.
