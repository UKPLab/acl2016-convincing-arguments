1624453916_74812	a2	Porn is not wrong. If it is really wrong, then Porn should be "Illegal". Porn supplies the "Erotic" needs of people who doesn't have a partner. :)	NO. I am a female who watches porn. <br/> It does not bother me if my boyfriend watches porn. <br/> I think its natural for people to have sexual desires. <br/> If people feel uncomfortable with the idea, just don't watch it. <br/> But, people who love porn can watch all the videos they want and I see no wrong with that.
49684_37291	a1	It is no more wrong than any other form of expression that is used for exploitation.	whatever ? <br/> porn is a f**king way of life ? <br/> i bet yous any money that all the people on the yes argument on how porn is wrong are virgins :L
13988_58869	a1	Everyone has their own desires, and sure women are degraded by pornography but it's their choice to choose that career path. If they want to be in that business, it's their choice.	porn is not wrong unless its sick porn eg child,animal or rape but the other pornography is ok aslong as its viewed in a discreet manner.
73596_37291	a1	All these arguments about that porn leads to addiction are annoying me now -_- . Porn hardly ever leads to addiction, just in weak people, maybe who have mental health issues, or attachment issues or find it hard to separate fantasy from reality. I watch porn once or twice a day when i'm on my own but also have a great boyfriend and we have sex once or twice (sometimes three, if i'm lucky!) times a week, we use porn to spice things up in the bedroom but we know it's all fantasy, we're not idiots, we just have desires that need to be met!	whatever ? <br/> porn is a f**king way of life ? <br/> i bet yous any money that all the people on the yes argument on how porn is wrong are virgins :L
13994_13993	a1	Whoever said porn degrades women is idiotic. #1 They get compensated well, #2 they CHOSE to do it, #3 some girls actually like what they do, #4 without sex and porn, you may not have been born. Sex = life. =)	No porn is not wrong. As an abstract noun, it cannot be wrong.
14009_37292	a1	Is porn wrong? Absolutley not!! Everyone has their own definition of morality. If you don't believe in it then don't look at it. The people who participate in it do it because they want to and they probably enjoy it. Whether your the person watching porn or participating in it, porn is a choice not a case of right or wrong.	hmm, yess there either all virgins or still live at home with there mothers and cant have porn LOL

13993_14003	a2	No porn is not wrong. As an abstract noun, it cannot be wrong.	Easy access to porn may be the reason there has been an 85 percent decline in rapes over the last 25 years, according to a law professor at Northwestern University.
36698_14002	a2	No porn is not wrong. Mabye some people thing it is wrong but really it is not. Come if their was no porn and sex how would we have babies.	If pornography and the people who produce it were well respected by society, then no argument could be made that porn was degrading anyone. <br/> Likewise, if, as a society we were to berate movie actors (for example), then the act of being an actor would become degrading. <br/> It isn't the act of producing the porn that needs to change, but rather the acceptance of it in society.

73596_37292	a1	All these arguments about that porn leads to addiction are annoying me now -_- . Porn hardly ever leads to addiction, just in weak people, maybe who have mental health issues, or attachment issues or find it hard to separate fantasy from reality. I watch porn once or twice a day when i'm on my own but also have a great boyfriend and we have sex once or twice (sometimes three, if i'm lucky!) times a week, we use porn to spice things up in the bedroom but we know it's all fantasy, we're not idiots, we just have desires that need to be met!	hmm, yess there either all virgins or still live at home with there mothers and cant have porn LOL
38908_35341	a2	i LIKE porn, jerking off is always a good time	it is not wrong, and if your talking about the actors doing the scene its theyre choice..they like doing it and its not degrading to women they wanna do it. we have freedom of expression you know. and it also helps some of us to be open about sex
36698_13986	a2	No porn is not wrong. Mabye some people thing it is wrong but really it is not. Come if their was no porn and sex how would we have babies.	All humans have sexual desires. Sometimes, one just isn't in the mood for sex, and would like simple release. Pornography facilitates this.
13988_14002	a2	Everyone has their own desires, and sure women are degraded by pornography but it's their choice to choose that career path. If they want to be in that business, it's their choice.

13994_69927	a1	Whoever said porn degrades women is idiotic. #1 They get compensated well, #2 they CHOSE to do it, #3 some girls actually like what they do, #4 without sex and porn, you may not have been born. Sex = life. =)	Some people say God is against porn. But we won't know that because the bible does not mench porn because it did not exist during biblical times. So how do we know it is a sin?
49684_13993	a1	It is no more wrong than any other form of expression that is used for exploitation.	No porn is not wrong. As an abstract noun, it cannot be wrong.
13987_54763	a2	Yeah, women are degraded by pornography, but if it's already done, why shouldn't we watch it?

69927_14002	a2	Some people say God is against porn. But we won't know that because the bible does not mench porn because it did not exist during biblical times. So how do we know it is a sin?	If pornography and the people who produce it were well respected by society, then no argument could be made that porn was degrading anyone. <br/> Likewise, if, as a society we were to berate movie actors (for example), then the act of being an actor would become degrading. <br/> It isn't the act of producing the porn that needs to change, but rather the acceptance of it in society.

14009_13994	a2	Is porn wrong? Absolutley not!! Everyone has their own definition of morality. If you don't believe in it then don't look at it. The people who participate in it do it because they want to and they probably enjoy it. Whether your the person watching porn or participating in it, porn is a choice not a case of right or wrong.	Whoever said porn degrades women is idiotic. #1 They get compensated well, #2 they CHOSE to do it, #3 some girls actually like what they do, #4 without sex and porn, you may not have been born. Sex = life. =)
13989_13991	a1	The question is: who has the right to prohibit it? Government? Why would there be any pressing need at all for the state to outlaw pornography?

I don't feel degraded by porn. You don't like it? Don't watch it. There are more importhant jobs in life than to be my personal morality police.
74812_58869	a1	NO. I am a female who watches porn. <br/> It does not bother me if my boyfriend watches porn. <br/> I think its natural for people to have sexual desires. <br/> If people feel uncomfortable with the idea, just don't watch it. <br/> But, people who love porn can watch all the videos they want and I see no wrong with that.	porn is not wrong unless its sick porn eg child,animal or rape but the other pornography is ok aslong as its viewed in a discreet manner.

Absolutley not!! Everyone has their own definition of morality. If you don't believe in it then don't look at it. The people who participate in it do it because they want to and they probably enjoy it. Whether your the person watching porn or participating in it, porn is a choice not a case of right or wrong.

Listen porn is not wrong because in schools that never give an accurate demonstration because of parents. Porn not only teaches but also gives prime examples.
69927_14003	a2	Some people say God is against porn. But we won't know that because the bible does not mench porn because it did not exist during biblical times. So how do we know it is a sin?

14000_13997	a1	Porn is anything but wrong in most cases. Sometimes it's in very bad taste, but when it's giving equal gratification, etc. to all parties, there's nothing wrong, and I could even consider it an art form in some respects.

73596_13989	a1	All these arguments about that porn leads to addiction are annoying me now -_- .

I watch porn once or twice a day when i'm on my own but also have a great boyfriend and we have sex once or twice (sometimes three, if i'm lucky!) times a week, we use porn to spice things up in the bedroom but we know it's all fantasy, we're not idiots, we just have desires that need to be met!
