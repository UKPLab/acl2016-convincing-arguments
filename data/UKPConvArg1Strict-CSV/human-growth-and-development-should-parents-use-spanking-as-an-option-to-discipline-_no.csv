arg334934_arg335091	a1	A parent shouldn't use spanking as an option to discipline a child because they might grow up traumatized and they might feel unloved since they would get spanked a lot, that will cause a low self of esteem. Also spanking shouldn't be an option because at that moment the parent would be full with anger and they wouldn't be thinking logically.	Parents shouldn't use spanking as an option to discipline it just makes the child get mad than to see what they did wrong.
arg335032_arg334961	a2	Spanking should never be the answer. Spanking should be the LAST option. <br/> Yes, I agree that if it gets to a certain point you can lightly spank the kid, but never to the point where you're beating the kid.	I say no because spanking doesn't really solve the problem, anyone can get over a spanking fast, and do whatever they did again. So its better to be a bit strict, than to abuse a kid.
arg334958_arg336204	a2	No, because they don't really understand what they are doing since they are barely growing up and still trying to understand the world.	I strongly believe parents should not use physical punishment like spanking to discipline their child. The child will obey if they have a strong healthy relationship with a parent, if they have gained their respect. The parents should have a friendly relationship with their child and the child will soon respect them and agree to what their parents decide although they may not like it. They will learn that the parents know whats best for them.

arg335086_arg335095	a2	The child is young and doesn't know what is wrong and what is right.	Spanking should not be an option to discipline a child, parents have a lot other options before spanking. Its better to talk to them about what they did wrong and solve the problem in a proper way.

Kids wouldnt learn the value of respect for their parents because they would only learn how to be scared.

arg335129_arg334907	a2	I don't think anybody would have liked to get spanked by there parents therefore , spanking shouldn't be an Option	Spanking children will bad for their development. We always teach children not to hurt others, but we do it on our children . It is not make sense.
arg334961_arg334926	a1	I say no because spanking doesn't really solve the problem, anyone can get over a spanking fast, and do whatever they did again. So its better to be a bit strict, than to abuse a kid.	No child should get hit. There are different punishments you could give your child.
arg334975_arg335030	a1	no, spanking is not the solution to your problems... <br/> u should talk to the kid with love and understanding, for them to be able to understand they are doing wrong..	Some kids don't learn by spanking them..So why waste your time on that, when you can always take something valuable away from them.
arg335114_arg334929	a2	There's some parents that spank their children for every little thing. And that is not right. They will always be scared of them.	No, i don't think they should be spanked because in my opinion i don't think it works, maybe it will once, but as they grow up it's not a good technique to do, because then y'all wont have a good relationship and the relationship will not grow. There is other techniques they can learn from.
arg335564_arg334890	a1	Nope. I believe it shouldnt be done just to discipline a child. Parents could just scold their child just so they would stop what they are doing wrong. Hitting is not really a solution because aside hurting a child emotionally, it also hurts them physically. Kids wouldnt learn the value of respect for their parents because they would only learn how to be scared. They wont do the wrong action again next time, not because they've learned their lesson, but because they are just scared that their parents would hit them	No, because they don't always need to get spanked for everything they do. Their parents need to teach them different ways.
arg335104_arg334975	a2	Because spanking is mostly out of anger and can be for more then what your kid had done like if some one else made thm mad thy let it all out on thm	no, spanking is not the solution to your problems... <br/> u should talk to the kid with love and understanding, for them to be able to understand they are doing wrong..

arg336204_arg334975	a1	I strongly believe parents should not use physical punishment like spanking to discipline their child. The child will obey if they have a strong healthy relationship with a parent, if they have gained their respect. The parents should have a friendly relationship with their child and the child will soon respect them and agree to what their parents decide although they may not like it. They will learn that the parents know whats best for them.	no, spanking is not the solution to your problems... <br/> u should talk to the kid with love and understanding, for them to be able to understand they are doing wrong..

arg336179_arg336172	a1	No because hitting your child could mentally scar them for life. also it can make them think hitting their kids is alright.	Not everything begins with violence, parents shouldn't hit kids for discipline, only if its necessary .

arg334934_arg334891	a1	A parent shouldn't use spanking as an option to discipline a child because they might grow up traumatized and they might feel unloved since they would get spanked a lot, that will cause a low self of esteem. Also spanking shouldn't be an option because at that moment the parent would be full with anger and they wouldn't be thinking logically.	Honestly, I believe that spanking shouldn't be accepted to discipline a child. There are many options that parents can take.

arg334934_arg336048	a1	A parent shouldn't use spanking as an option to discipline a child because they might grow up traumatized and they might feel unloved since they would get spanked a lot, that will cause a low self of esteem. Also spanking shouldn't be an option because at that moment the parent would be full with anger and they wouldn't be thinking logically.	People should not hit there kids because the kid will think it is OK to hit someone else back like for an example at school they will end up fighting and abusive to others.

arg335030_arg334929	a2	Some kids don't learn by spanking them..So why waste your time on that, when you can always take something valuable away from them.	No, i don't think they should be spanked because in my opinion i don't think it works, maybe it will once, but as they grow up it's not a good technique to do, because then y'all wont have a good relationship and the relationship will not grow. There is other techniques they can learn from.
arg336209_arg335086	a2	No because if we hit our children their gonna think that we don't love them.	The child is young and doesn't know what is wrong and what is right.

arg335112_arg335132	a2	Honestly, I Think It's better to try a different option besides spanking that can affect a child's way of thinking and may get depressed	I disagree on the parents use spaking as an option to dicipline because the childrens are not going to be scare of what their parents are going to them and also because if you do that to your childrens are learning what their parents show them and also because that is not going to help that much the childrens

No because spanking might effects the relationship between the child and parents. And Children can pick up on the parents attitude acting violent.
